<h2>Models</h2>
<p>The model construction process has been made lighter. Models
associations are now lazy loaded, applications with lots of models
and associations will see great time reductions in the bootstrap
process.</p>
<p>Now models won't require a database connection in the
construction process, database will be accessed for the first time
only when a find operation is issued or information for one of the
columns is required.</p>
<h2>Behaviors</h2>
<p>--</p>
<h2>Helpers</h2>
<h3>HtmlHelper</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>getCrumbsList()</code> Creates breadcrumb links wrapped
in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements. See <a href=
"tickets/856" title="Ticket #856">#856</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>FormHelper</h3>
<ul>
<li>FormHelper now supports all HTML5 input types and custom input
types. Just use the input type you want as the method on the
helper. For example <code>$this-&gt;Form-&gt;range()</code> would
create an input with type = range.</li>
<li><code>postLink()</code> and <code>postButton()</code> Creates
link/button to access some page using HTTP method POST. With this,
in your controller you can avoid some action, like delete, to be
accessed by GET method.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Libs</h2>
<h3>CakeRequest</h3>
<p><code>CakeRequest</code> is a new class introduced in 2.0. It
encapsulates commonly used request introspection methods and
replaces the <code>params</code> array with a more useful object.
<a href="20-cakerequest">Read more about
CakeRequest</a></p>
<h3>CakeResponse</h3>
<p><code>CakeResponse</code> is a new class introduced in 2.0. It
encapsulates commonly used method and properties in the HTTP
response your application generates. It consolidates several
features in CakePHP. <a href="20-cakeresponse">Read
more about CakeResponse</a></p>
<h3>CakeSession, SessionComponent</h3>
<p>CakeSession and the SessionComponent have had a number of
changes, see <a href="20-session">the session
section</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Router</h3>
<h4>Routes can return full urls</h4>
<p>Route objects can now return full urls, and Router will not
further modify them beyond adding the query string and fragment
elements. For example this could be used to create routes to handle
subdomains, or enabling https/http flags. An example of a route
class that supports subdomains would be:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php

class SubdomainRoute extends CakeRoute {

    public function match ($params) {
        $subdomain = isset($params['subdomain']) ? $params['subdomain'] : null;
        unset($params['subdomain']);
        $path = parent::match($params);
        if ($subdomain) {
            $path = 'http://' . $subdomain . '.localhost' . $path;
        }
        return $path;
    }

}
?&gt;
</pre>
<p>When creating links you could do the following to make links
pointing at other subdomains.</p>
<pre>
<code>echo $this-&gt;Html-&gt;link(
     'Other domain',
     array('subdomain' =&gt; 'test', 'controller' =&gt; 'posts', 'action' =&gt; 'add')
);</code>
</pre>
<p>The above would create a link with
<code>http://test.localhost/posts/add</code> as the url.</p>
<h3>Xml</h3>
<p>Xml has had a number of changes. <a href=
"20-xml">Read more about Xml class</a></p>
<h2>New Lib features</h2>
<h3>Configure readers</h3>
<p>Configure can now be configured to load configuration files from
a variety of sources and formats. <a href=
"20-configure">The new Configure features</a>
section contains more information about the changes made to
configure.</p>
<p><code>Configure::read()</code> without any arguments allows you
to read all values from configure, instead of just the debug
value.</p>
<h3>Error and exception handling</h3>
<p>CakePHP 2.0 has had <a href=
"20-exceptions-error">error and exception
handling</a> rebuilt, to be more flexible and give more power to
developers.</p>
<h3>String::wrap()</h3>
<p><code>String::wrap()</code> was added to help making fixed width
formatting of text easier. Its used in Shells whenever you use
<code>Shell::wrapText()</code></p>
<h3>debug()</h3>
<p><code>debug()</code> no longer outputs html in the console.
Instead it makes output like the following</p>
<pre>
<code>########## DEBUG ##########
Array
(
    [0] =&gt; test
)
###########################</code>
</pre>
<p>This should improve readability of <code>debug()</code> on the
command line.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Components received a similar treatment to helpers and
behvaiors, <code>Component</code> is now the base class for
components. <a href=
"20-helper-behavior-component-and-task-refactor">Read
more about the component changes</a></p>
<h3>RequestHandler</h3>
<p>RequestHandler was heavily refactored do to the introduction of
<code>CakeRequest</code>. These changes allowed for some new
features to be introduced as well.</p>
<h4>Automatic parsing of Accept headers</h4>
<p>If a client sends a single <code>Accept</code> mime type that
matches one of the extensions enabled in <code>Router</code>,
RequestHandler will treat it the same an extension. This expands
CakePHP's support for REST style endpoints. To use this feature
start off by enabling extensions in
<code>config/routes.php</code></p>
<pre>
<code>Router::parseExtensions('json', 'xml');</code>
</pre>
<p>Once you have created layouts and views for your extensions, you
will be able to visit a url like <code>posts/view/1</code> and send
<code>Accept: application/json</code> in the headers to receive the
json version of that url.</p>
<h3>CookieComponent</h3>
<p>CookieComponent now supports http only cookies. You can enable
their use by setting <code>$this-&gt;Cookie-&gt;httpOnly =
true;</code>. Having http only cookies will make them unaccessible
from the browser.</p>
<h3>Security Component CSRF separation</h3>
<p>CakePHP has has CSRF protection since 1.2. For 2.0 the existing
CSRF has a new more paranoid mode, and is its own standalone
feature. In the past CSRF features were coupled with form tampering
safe-guards. Developers often disabled <code>validatePost</code> in
order to do dynamic forms, disabling the CSRF protection at the
same time. For 2.0 CSRF checking has been separated from form
tampering giving you greater control.</p>
<h4>Using CSRF protection in CakePHP 2.0</h4>
<p>Simply by adding the <code>SecurityComponent</code> to your
components array, you can benefit from the CSRF protection it
provides. By default CSRF nonces are valid for 30 minutes. You can
control how long tokens last by setting <code>csrfExpires</code> on
the component.</p>
<pre>
<code>$components = array(
    'Security' =&gt; array(
        'csrfExpires' =&gt; '+1 hour'
    )
);</code>
</pre>
<p>You can also set this property in your controller's
<code>beforeFilter</code></p>
<pre>
<code>function beforeFilter() {
    $this-&gt;Security-&gt;csrfExpires = '+1 hour';
    ...
}</code>
</pre>
<p>The <code>csrfExpires</code> property can be any value that is
compatible with <code>strtotime()</code>. By default the
<code>FormHelper</code> will add a <code>data[_Token][key]</code>
containing the CSRF token to every form when the component is
enabled.</p>
<h4>Handling missing or expired tokens</h4>
<p>Missing or expired tokens are handled similar to in previous
versions. The SecurityComponent's <code>blackHoleCallback</code>
will be called, but with a 'csrf' parameter instead of 'auth' as in
previous versions. This helps you better filter out CSRF token
failures.</p>
<h4>Using per-session tokens instead of one-time use tokens</h4>
<p>By default a new CSRF token is generated for each request, and
each token can only be used one. If a token is used twice, it will
be blackholed. Sometimes, this behaviour is not desirable, as it
can create issues with single page applications. You can toggle on
longer, multi-use tokens by setting <code>csrfUseOnce</code> to
false. This can be done in the components array, or in the
<code>beforeFilter</code> of your controller.</p>
<pre>
<code>var $components = array(
    'Security' =&gt; array(
        'csrfUseOnce' =&gt; false
    )
);</code>
</pre>
<p>This will tell the component that you want to re-use a CSRF
token until it expires. If you are having issues with expired
tokens, this is a good balance between security and ease of
use.</p>
<h4>Disabling the CSRF protection</h4>
<p>There may be cases where you want to disable CSRF protection on
your forms for some reason. If you do want to disable this feature,
you can set <code>$this-&gt;Security-&gt;csrfCheck = false;</code>
in your beforeFilter or use the components array. By default CSRF
protection is enabled, and configured to use one-use tokens.</p>
<h2>Controller</h2>
<p>Controllers now have access to request and response objects. You
can read more about these objects on their specific pages.</p>
<h2>Console</h2>
<p>The console for CakePHP 2.0 was almost entirely rebuilt. Several
new features as well as some backwards incompatible changes were
made. <a href="20-console">Read more about console
changes</a></p>
<h2>Pagination</h2>
<p>Pagination now provides a default maxLimit for pagination at
100.</p>
<p>This limit can be overridden with the paginate variable on
Controller.</p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;paginate = array('maxLimit' =&gt; 1000);</code>
</pre>
<p>This default is provided to prevent user URL manipulation
causing excessive strain on the database for subsequent requests,
where a user would edit the 'limit' parameter to a very large
number.</p>
