<h2>Models</h2> 
<p>The model construction process has been made lighter. Models
associations are now lazy loaded, applications with lots of models
and associations will see great time reductions in the bootstrap
process.</p> 
<p>Now models won't require a database connection in the
construction process, database will be accessed for the first time
only when a find operation is issued or information for one of the
columns is required.</p>

<h2>Libs</h2> 
<h3>CakeRequest</h3> 
<p><code>CakeRequest</code> is a new class introduced in 2.0. It
encapsulates commonly used request introspection methods and
replaces the <code>params</code> array with a more useful
object.</p> 
<h2>Components</h2> 
<h3>RequestHandler</h3> 
<p>RequestHandler was heavily refactored do to the introduction of
<code>CakeRequest</code>. These changes allowed for some new
features to be introduced as well.</p> 
<h4>Automatic parsing of Accept headers</h4> 
<p>If a client sends a single <code>Accept</code> mime type that
matches one of the extensions enabled in <code>Router</code>,
RequestHandler will treat it the same an extension. This expands
CakePHP's support for REST style endpoints. To use this feature
start off by enabling extensions in
<code>config/routes.php</code></p> 
<pre> 
<code>Router::parseExtensions('json', 'xml');</code> 
</pre> 
<p>Once you have created layouts and views for your extensions, you
will be able to visit a url like <code>posts/view/1</code> and send
<code>Accept: application/json</code> in the headers to receive the
json version of that url.</p>
