<h1>Using AuthComponent</h1>
<p>Identifying, authenticating and authorizing users is a common
part of almost every web application. In CakePHP AuthComponent
provides a pluggable way to do these tasks. AuthComponent allows
you to combine authentication objects, and authorization objects to
create flexible ways of identifying and checking user
authorization.</p>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication is the process of identifying users by provided
credentials and ensuring that users are who they say they are.
Generally this is done through a username and password, that are
checked against a known list of users. In CakePHP, there are
several built in ways of authenticating users stored in your
application.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>FormAuthenticate</code> allows you to authenticate users
based on form POST data. Usually this is a login form that users
enter information into.</li>
<li><code>BasicAuthenticate</code> allows you to authenticate users
using Basic HTTP authentication.</li>
<li><code>DigestAuthenticate</code> allows you to authenticate
users using Digest HTTP authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default <code>AuthComponent</code> uses
<code>FormAuthenticate</code>.</p>
<h3>Configuring Authentication handlers</h3>
<p>You configure authentication handlers using
<code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authenticate</code>. You can configure one
or many handlers for authentication. Using multiple handlers allows
you to support different ways of logging users in. When logging
users in, authentication handlers are checked in the order they are
declared. Once one handler is able to identify the user, no other
handlers will be checked. Conversely you can halt all
authentication by throwing an exception. You will need to catch any
thrown exceptions, and handle them as needed.</p>
<p>You can configure authentication handlers in your controller's
<code>beforeFilter</code> or, in the <code>$components</code>
array. You can pass configuration information into each
authentication object, using an array.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
// Basic setup
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authenticate = array('Form');

// Pass settings in
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authenticate = array(
    'Form' =&gt; array('userModel' =&gt; 'Users.User'),
    'Basic' =&gt; array('userModel' =&gt; 'Users.User')
);</code>
</pre>
<p>In the second example you'll notice that we had to declare the
<code>userModel</code> key twice. To help you keep your code DRY,
you can use the <code>all</code> key. This special key allows you
to set settings that are passed to every attached object. The all
key is also exposed as <code>AuthComponent::ALL</code>.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
// Pass settings in using 'all'
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authenticate = array(
    AuthComponent::ALL =&gt; array('userModel' =&gt; 'Users.User')
    'Form',
    'Basic'
);</code>
</pre>
<p>In the above example, both <code>Form</code> and
<code>Basic</code> will get the settings defined for the 'all' key.
Any settings passed to a specific authentication object will
override the matching key in the 'all' key. The core authentication
objects support the following configuration keys.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fields</code> The fields to use to identify a user
by.</li>
<li><code>userModel</code> The model name of the User, defaults to
User.</li>
<li><code>scope</code> Additional conditions to use when looking up
and authenticating users, i.e. <code>array('User.is_active' =&gt;
1).</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the common configuration, Basic authentication
supports the following keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>realm</code> The realm being authenticated. Defaults to
<code>env('SERVER_NAME')</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the common configuration Digest authentication
supports the following keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>realm</code> The realm authentication is for, Defaults to
the servername.</li>
<li><code>nonce</code> A nonce used for authentication. Defaults to
<code>uniqid()</code>.</li>
<li><code>qop</code> Defaults to auth, no other values are
supported at this time.</li>
<li><code>opaque</code> A string that must be returned unchanged by
clients. Defaults to <code>md5($settings['realm'])</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating Custom Authentication objects</h3>
<p>Because authentication objects are pluggable, you can create
custom authentication objects in your application or plugins. If
for example you wanted to create an OpenID authentication object.
In
<code>app/controller/components/auth/openid_authenticate.php</code>
you could put the following:</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
App::import('Component', 'auth/base_authenticate');

class OpenidAuthenticate extends BaseAuthenticate {
    public function authenticate(CakeRequest $request, CakeResponse $response) {
        // Do things for openid here.
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Authentication objects should return <code>false</code> if they
cannot identify the user. And an array of user information if they
can. Its not required that you extend
<code>BaseAuthenticate</code>, only that your authentication object
implements an <code>authenticate()</code> method. The
<code>BaseAuthenticate</code> class provides a number of helpful
methods that are commonly used. You can also implement a
<code>getUser()</code> method if your authentication object needs
to support stateless or cookie-less authentication. See the
sections on basic and digest authentication below for more
information.</p>
<h4>Using custom authentication objects</h4>
<p>Once you've created your custom authentication object, you can
use them by including them in AuthComponents authenticate
array.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authenticate = array(
    'Openid', // app authentication object.
    'AuthBag.Combo', // plugin authentication object.
);</code>
</pre>
<h3>Identifying users and logging them in</h3>
<p>In the past <code>AuthComponent</code> auto-magically logged
users in. This was confusing for many people, and made using
AuthComponent a bit difficult at times. For 2.0, you'll need to
manually call <code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;login()</code> to log a user
in.<br>
When authenticating users, attached authentication objects are
checked in the order they are attached. Once one of the objects can
identify the user, no other objects are checked. A sample login
function for working with a login form could look like:</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
public function login() {
    if ($this-&gt;request-&gt;is('post')) {
        if ($this-&gt;Auth-&gt;login()) {
            return $this-&gt;redirect($this-&gt;Auth-&gt;redirect());
        } else {
            $this-&gt;Session-&gt;setFlash(__('Username or password is incorrect'), 'default', array(), 'auth');
        }
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>The above code, will attempt to log a user in using the POST
data, and if successful redirect the user to either the last page
they were visiting, or <code>AuthComponent::$loginRedirect</code>.
If the login is unsuccessful, a flash message is set.</p>
<h3>Using Digest and Basic Authentication for logging in</h3>
<p>Because basic and digest authentication don't require an initial
POST to be performed before they initiate the login sequence, your
<code>login()</code> function will look a bit different than when
using <code>FormAuthentication</code>.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
public function login() {
    if ($this-&gt;Auth-&gt;login()) {
        return $this-&gt;redirect($this-&gt;Auth-&gt;redirect());
    } else {
        $this-&gt;Session-&gt;setFlash(__('Username or password is incorrect'), 'default', array(), 'auth');
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Once logged in, users using digest and basic auth are not
required to have cookies. In fact, all authentication objects are
able to provide <em>stateless</em> authentication through
implementing the <code>getUser()</code> method. If the client
supports cookies, basic and digest auth will store a user in
session much like any other authentication object. If a client
doesn't support cookies, (such as a simple HTTP client built on top
of CURL) stateless authentication is also supported. Stateless
authentication will re-verify the user's credentials on each
request, this creates a small amount of additional overhead, but
allows clients that cannot or do not support cookies to login
in.</p>
<h3>Creating stateless authentication systems</h3>
<p>Authentication objects can implement a <code>getUser()</code>
method that can be used to support user login systems that don't
rely on cookies. A typical getUser method looks at the
request/environment and uses the information there to confirm the
identity of the user. HTTP Basic authentication for example uses
<code>$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER]</code> and
<code>$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW]</code> for the username and password
fields. On each request, if a client doesn't support cookies, these
values are used to re-identify the user and ensure they are valid
user. As with authentication object's <code>authenticate()</code>
method the <code>getUser()</code> method should return an array of
user information on success, and <code>false</code> on failure.</p>
<pre>
<code>public function getUser($request) {
    $username = env('PHP_AUTH_USER');
    $pass = env('PHP_AUTH_PW');

    if (empty($username) || empty($pass)) {
        return false;
    }
    return $this-&gt;_findUser($username, $pass);
}</code>
</pre>
<p>The above is how you could implement getUser method for HTTP
basic authentication. The <code>_findUser()</code> method is part
of <code>BaseAuthenticate</code> and identifies a user based on a
username and password.</p>
<h3>Displaying auth related flash messages</h3>
<p>In order to display the session error messages that Auth
generates, you need to add the following code to your layout. Add
the following two lines to the views/layouts/default.ctp file in
the body section preferable before the content_for_layout line.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
echo $this-&gt;Session-&gt;flash();
echo $this-&gt;Session-&gt;flash('auth');
?&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>You can customize the error messages, and flash settings
AuthComponent uses. Using <code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;flash</code> you
can configure the parameters AuthComponent uses for setting flash
messages. The available keys are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>element</code> - The element to use, defaults to
'default'.</li>
<li><code>key</code> - The key to use, defaults to 'auth'</li>
<li><code>params</code> - The array of additional params to use,
defaults to array()</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the flash message settings you can customize
other error messages AuthComponent uses. In your controller's
beforeFilter, or component settings you can use
<code>authError</code> to customize the error used for when
authorization fails.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authError = "This error shows up with the user tries to access a part of the website that is protected.";</code>
</pre>
<h3>Hashing passwords</h3>
<p>AuthComponent no longer automatically hashes every password it
can find. This was removed because it made a number of common tasks
like validation difficult. You should <strong>never</strong> store
plain text passwords, and before saving a user record you should
always hash the password. You can use the static
<code>AuthComponent::password()</code> to hash passwords before
saving them. This will use the configured hashing strategy for your
application.</p>
<p>After validating the password, you can hash a password in the
beforeSave callback of your model:</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
class User extends AppModel {
    function beforeSave($options = array()) {
        $this-&gt;data['User']['password'] = AuthComponent::password($this-&gt;data['User']['password']);
        return true;
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>You don't need to hash passwords before calling
<code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;login()</code>. The various authentication
objects will hash passwords individually. If you are using Digest
authentication, use should not use AuthComponent::password() for
generating passwords. See below for how to generate digest
hashes.</p>
<h4>Hashing passwords for digest authentication</h4>
<p>Because Digest authentication requires a password hashed in the
format defined by the RFC. In order to correctly hash a password
for use with Digest authentication you should use the special
password hashing function on <code>DigestAuthenticate</code>. If
you are going to be combining digest authentication with any other
authentication strategies, its also recommended that you store the
digest password in a separate column, from the normal password
hash.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
class User extends AppModel {
    function beforeSave($options = array()) {
        // make a password for digest auth.
        $this-&gt;data['User']['digest_hash'] = DigestAuthenticate::password(
            $this-&gt;data['User']['username'], $this-&gt;data['User']['password'], env('SERVER_NAME')
        );
        return true;
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Passwords for digest authentication need a bit more information
than other password hashes, based on the RFC for digest
authentication. If you use AuthComponent::password() for digest
hashes you will not be able to login.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The third parameter of
DigestAuthenticate::password() must match the 'realm' config value
defined when DigestAuthentication was configured in
AuthComponent::$authenticate. This defaults to
<code>env('SCRIPT_NAME)</code>. You may wish to use a static string
if you want consistent hashes in multiple environments.</p>
<h3>Manually logging users in</h3>
<p>Sometimes the need arises where you need to manually log a user
in, such as just after they registered for your application. You
can do this by calling <code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;login()</code> with
the user data you want to 'login'.</p>
<pre>
<code>public function register() {
    if ($this-&gt;User-&gt;save($this-&gt;request-&gt;data)) {
        $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;login($this-&gt;request-&gt;data['User']);
        $this-&gt;redirect('/users/home');
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<h3>Accessing the logged in user</h3>
<p>Once a user is logged in, you will often need some particular
information about the current user. You can access the currently
logged in user using <code>AuthComponent::user()</code>. This
method is static, and can be used globally after the AuthComponent
has been loaded. You can access it both as an instance method or as
a static method.</p>
<pre>
<code>// Use anywhere
AuthComponent::user('id')

// From inside a controller
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;user('id');</code>
</pre>
<h3>Logging users out</h3>
<p>Eventually you'll want a quick way to de-authenticate someone,
and redirect them to where they need to go. This method is also
useful if you want to provide a 'Log me out' link inside a members'
area of your application.</p>
<pre>
<code>public function logout() {
    $this-&gt;redirect($this-&gt;Auth-&gt;logout());
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Logging out users that logged in with Digest or Basic auth is
difficult to accomplish for all clients. Most browsers will retain
credentials for the duration they are still open. Some clients can
be forced to logout by sending a 401 status code. Changing the
authentication realm is another solution that works for some
clients.</p>
<h2>Authorization</h2>
<p>Authorization is the process of ensuring that an
identified/authenticated user is allowed to access the resources
they are requesting. If enabled <code>AuthComponent</code> can
automatically check authorization handlers and ensure that logged
in users are allowed to access the resources they are requesting.
There are several built-in authorization handlers, and you can
create custom ones for your application, or as part of a
plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ActionsAuthorize</code> Uses the AclComponent to check
for permissions on an action level.</li>
<li><code>CrudAuthorize</code> Uses the AclComponent and action
-&gt; CRUD mappings to check permissions for resources.</li>
<li><code>ControllerAuthorize</code> Calls
<code>isAuthorized()</code> on the active controller, and uses the
return of that to authorize a user. This is often the most simple
way to authorize users.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configuring Authorization handlers</h3>
<p>You configure authorization handlers using
<code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize</code>. You can configure one or
many handlers for authorization. Using multiple handlers allows you
to support different ways of checking authorization. When
authorization handlers are checked, they will be called in the
order they are declared. Handlers should return false, if they are
unable to check authorization, or the check has failed. Handlers
should return true if they were able to check authorization
successfully. Handlers will be called in sequence until one passes.
If all checks fail, the user will be redirected to the page they
came from. Additionally you can halt all authorization by throwing
an exception. You will need to catch any thrown exceptions, and
handle them.</p>
<p>You can configure authorization handlers in your controller's
<code>beforeFilter</code> or, in the <code>$components</code>
array. You can pass configuration information into each
authorization object, using an array.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
// Basic setup
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = array('Controller');

// Pass settings in
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = array(
    'Actions' =&gt; array('actionPath' =&gt; 'controllers/'),
    'Controller'
);</code>
</pre>
<p>Much like <code>Auth-&gt;authenticate</code>,
<code>Auth-&gt;authorize</code>, allows helps you keep your code
DRY, by using the <code>all</code> key. This special key allows you
to set settings that are passed to every attached object. The all
key is also exposed as <code>AuthComponent::ALL</code>.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
// Pass settings in using 'all'
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = array(
    AuthComponent::ALL =&gt; array('actionPath' =&gt; 'controllers/')
    'Actions',
    'Controller'
);</code>
</pre>
<p>In the above example, both the <code>Actions</code> and
<code>Controller</code> will get the settings defined for the 'all'
key. Any settings passed to a specific authentication object will
override the matching key in the 'all' key. The core authorize
objects support the following configuration keys.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>actionPath</code> Used by <code>ActionsAuthorize</code>
to locate controller action ACO's in the ACO tree.</li>
<li><code>actionMap</code> Action -&gt; CRUD mappings. Used by
<code>CrudAuthorize</code> and authorization objects that want to
map actions to CRUD roles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating Custom Authorize objects</h3>
<p>Because authorize objects are pluggable, you can create custom
authorize objects in your application or plugins. If for example
you wanted to create an LDAP authorize object. In
<code>app/controller/components/auth/ldap_authorize.php</code> you
could put the following:</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
App::import('Component', 'auth/base_authorize');

class LdapAuthorize extends BaseAuthorize {
    public function authorize($user, CakeRequest $request); {
        // Do things for ldap here.
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Authorize objects should return <code>false</code> if the user
is denied access, or if the object is unable to perform a check. If
the object is able to verify the user's access, <code>true</code>
should be returned. Its not required that you extend
<code>BaseAuthorize</code>, only that your authorize object
implements an <code>authorize()</code> method. The
<code>BaseAuthorize</code> class provides a number of helpful
methods that are commonly used.</p>
<h4>Using custom authorize objects</h4>
<p>Once you've created your custom authorize object, you can use
them by including them in AuthComponents authorize array.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = array(
    'Ldap', // app authorize object.
    'AuthBag.Combo', // plugin authorize object.
);</code>
</pre>
<h3>Using no authorization</h3>
<p>If you'd like to not use any of the built-in authorization
objects, and want to handle things entirely outside of
AuthComponent you can set <code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize =
false;</code>. By default AuthComponent starts off with
<code>authorize = false</code>. If you don't use an authorization
scheme, make sure to check authorization yourself in your
controller's beforeFilter, or with another component.</p>
<h3>Making actions public</h3>
<p>There are often times controller actions that you wish to remain
entirely public, or that don't require users to be logged in.
AuthComponent is pessimistic, and defaults to denying access. You
can mark actions as public actions by using
<code>AuthComponent::allow()</code>. By marking actions as public,
AuthComponent, will not check for a logged in user, nor will
authorize objects be checked.</p>
<pre>
<code>// Allow all actions.
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;allow('*');

// Allow only the view and index actions.
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;allow('view', 'index');

// Allow only the view and index actions.
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;allow(array('view', 'index'));</code>
</pre>
<p>You can provide as many action names as you need to
<code>allow()</code>. You can also supply an array containing all
the action names.</p>
<h3>Making actions require authorization</h3>
<p>If after making actions public, you want to revoke the public
access. You can do so using <code>AuthComponent::deny()</code>.</p>
<pre>
<code>// remove one action
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;deny('add');

// remove all the actions.
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;deny('*');

// remove a group of actions.
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;deny('add', 'edit');
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;deny(array('add', 'edit'));</code>
</pre>
<p>You can provide as many action names as you need to
<code>deny()</code>. You can also supply an array containing all
the action names.</p>
<h3>Mapping actions when using CrudAuthorize</h3>
<p>When using CrudAuthorize or any other authorize objects that use
action mappings, it is might be necessary to map additional
methods. You can map actions -&gt; CRUD permissions using
mapAction(). Calling this on AuthComponent will delegate to all the
of the configured authorize objects, so you can be sure the
settings were applied every where.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;mapActions(array(
    'create' =&gt; array('register'),
    'view' =&gt; array('show', 'display')
));</code>
</pre>
<p>The keys for mapActions should be the CRUD permissions you want
to set, while the values should be an array of all the actions that
are mapped to the CRUD permission.</p>
<h3>Using ControllerAuthorize</h3>
<p>ControllerAuthorize allows you to handle authorization checks in
a controller callback. This is ideal when you have very simple
authorization, or you need to use a combination of models +
components to do your authorization, and don't want to create a
custom authorize object.</p>
<p>The callback is always called <code>isAuthorized()</code> and it
should return a boolean as to whether or not the user is allowed to
access resources in the request. The callback is passed the active
user, so it can be checked.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;?php
class AppController extends Controller {
    function isAuthorized($user) {
        if (isset($this-&gt;request-&gt;params['admin'])) {
            return (bool)($user['role'] == 'admin')
        }
        return true;
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>The above callback would provide a very simple authorization
system where, only users with role = admin could access actions
that were in the admin prefix.</p>
<h3>Using ActionsAuthorize</h3>
<p>ActionsAuthorize integrates with the AclComponent, and provides
a fine grained per action ACL check on each request.
ActionsAuthorize is often paired with DbAcl to give dynamic and
flexible permission systems that can be edited by admin users
through the application. It can however, be combined with other Acl
implementations such as IniAcl and custom application Acl
backends.</p>
<h3>Using CrudAuthorize</h3>
<p>CrudAuthorize integrates with AclComponent, and provides the
ability to map requests to CRUD operations. Provides the ability to
authorize using CRUD mappings. These mapped results are then
checked in the AclComponent as specific permissions.</p>
<p>For example, taking <code>/posts/index</code> as the current
request. The default mapping for <code>index</code>, is a
<code>read</code> permission check. The Acl check would then be for
the <code>posts</code> controller with the <code>read</code>
permission. This allows you to create permission systems that focus
more on what is being done to resources, rather than the specific
actions being visited.</p>
