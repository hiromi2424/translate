<h3>Session Configuration</h3>
<p>Session configuration historically has been scattered across
several settings, is fairly incomplete, and inconsistent with the
granularity of control afforded. CakePHP is founded on conventions
over configuration, and any replacement solution for session
configuration should keep that idea in mind.</p>
<h3>Current Configuration options</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>Session.save</code> - how to save sessions. Implements
different handlers, and allows for custom user handlers. Which do
not benefit from any conventions.</li>
<li><code>Session.model, Session.table, Session.database</code> -
All related to database sessions, that are enabled by Session.save
== database.</li>
<li><code>Session.cookie</code> - Change the name of the session
cookie.</li>
<li><code>Session.timeout</code> - A modifier value for session
timeouts, and in 1.3 cookie timeouts.</li>
<li><code>Session.start</code> - Do you actually want to use the
sessions you configured, automatically?</li>
<li><code>Session.checkAgent</code> - Should the user agent be
checked, on each request.</li>
<li><code>Security.level</code> - A big factor in session
configuration, even though its not called that.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations with the current configuration</h3>
<p>There are a few issues with the current session configuration
and implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Db/Cache Sessions are mixed in with other Session related
features. I think these should be separated, as they are different
roles and responsibilities.</li>
<li>Needing to set additional ini flags and attempting to use a
core session macro is not possible.</li>
<li>Controlling the https flag for sessions requires a full custom
handler.</li>
<li>Core and userland configurations are two totally separate code
paths, meaning a reasonable amount of duplication to make
changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session Changes in 2.0</h2>
<p>CakeSession and SessionComponent have been simplified and made
more flexible for 2.0. A number of hidden magic parts have been
removed, and replaced with a more 'what you type is what you get'
system. These changes also give you more control and flexibility in
configuring your session, without sacrificing the ease of just
getting sessions working the CakePHP has always offered.</p>
<h3>Session Configuration</h3>
<p>Session configuration is still stored in <code>Configure</code>.
The number of configuration options have been expanded and made
more simple. A laundry list of all available is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Session.cookie</code> - Change the name of the session
cookie.</li>
<li><code>Session.timeout</code> - The number of <em>minutes</em>
you want sessions to last.</li>
<li><code>Session.cookieTimeout</code> - The number of
<em>minutes</em> you want sessions to last. If this is undefined,
the value from <code>Session.timeout</code> will be used.</li>
<li><code>Session.checkAgent</code> - Should the user agent be
checked, on each request. If the useragent does not match the
session will be destroyed.</li>
<li><code>Session.autoRegenerate</code> - Auto regeneration used to
only be available when <code>Security.level</code> was set to high.
Enabling this setting, turns on automatic renewal of sessions, and
sessionids that change frequently.</li>
<li><code>Session.defaults</code> - Allows you to use one the
built-in default session configurations as a base for your session
configuration.</li>
<li><code>Session.handler</code> - Allows you to define a custom
session handler. The core database and cache session handlers use
this. This option replaces <code>Session.save</code> in previous
versions. See below for additional information on Session
handlers.</li>
<li><code>Session.ini</code> - Allows you to set additional session
ini settings for your config. This combined with
<code>Session.handler</code> replace the custom session handling
features of previous versions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using defaults</h3>
<p>CakePHP comes with several built in session configurations. You
can either use these as the basis for your session configuration,
or you can create a fully custom solution. To use defaults, simply
set the 'defaults' key to the name of the default you want to use.
You can then override any sub setting by declaring it in your
Session config.</p>
<pre>
<code>Configure::write('Session', array(
    'defaults' =&gt; 'php'
));</code>
</pre>
<p>p. The above will use the built-in 'php' session configuration.
You could augment part or all of it by doing the following:</p>
<pre>
<code>Configure::write('Session', array(
    'defaults' =&gt; 'php',
    'cookie' =&gt; 'my_app',
    'timeout' =&gt; 4320 //3 days
));</code>
</pre>
<p>The above overrides the timeout and cookie name for the 'php'
session configuration. The built-in configurations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>php</code> - Saves sessions with the standard settings in
your php.ini file.</li>
<li><code>cake</code> - Saves sessions as files inside
<code>app/tmp/sessions</code>. This is a good option when on hosts
that don't allow you to write outside your own home dir.</li>
<li><code>database</code> - Use the built in database sessions. See
below for more information.</li>
<li><code>cache</code> - Use the built in cache sessions. See below
for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Session Handlers</h3>
<p>Session handlers can also be defined in the session config
array. When defined they allow you to map the various
<code>session_save_handler</code> values to a class or object you
want to use for session saving. There are two ways to use the
'handler'. The first is to provide an array with 5 callables. These
callables are then applied to
<code>session_set_save_handler</code>.</p>
<pre>
<code>Configure::write('Session', array(
    'userAgent' =&gt; false,
    'cookie' =&gt; 'my_cookie',
    'timeout' =&gt; 600,
    'handler' =&gt; array(
        array('Foo', 'open'),
        array('Foo', 'close'),
        array('Foo', 'read'),
        array('Foo', 'write'),
        array('Foo', 'destroy'),
        array('Foo', 'gc'),
    ),
    'ini' =&gt; array(
        'cookie_secure' =&gt; 1,
        'use_trans_sid' =&gt; 0
    )
));</code>
</pre>
<p>The second mode is to define an 'engine' key. This key should be
a classname that implements
<code>CakeSessionHandlerInterface</code>. Implementing this
interface will allow CakeSession to automatically map the methods
for the handler. Both the core Cache and Database session handlers
use this method for saving sessions. Additional settings for the
handler should be placed inside the handler array. You can then
read those values out from inside your handler.</p>
<p>You can also use session handlers from inside plugins. By
setting the engine to something like
<code>MyPlugin.PluginSessionHandler</code>. This will load and use
the <code>PluginSessionHandler</code> class from inside the
MyPlugin of your application.</p>
<h3>CakeSessionHandlerInterface</h3>
<p>This interface is used for all custom session handlers inside
CakePHP, and can be used to create custom user land session
handlers. Simply implement the interface in your class and set
<code>Session.handler.engine</code> to the classname you've
created. CakePHP will attempt to load the handler from inside
<code>app/libs/session/$classname.php</code>. So if your classname
is <code>AppSessionHandler</code> the file should be
<code>app/libs/session/app_session_handler.php</code>.</p>
<h3>Database sessions</h3>
<p>The changes in session configuration change how you define
database sessions. Most of the time you will only need to set
<code>Session.handler.model</code> in your configuration as well as
choose the database defaults.</p>
<pre>
<code>Configure::write('Session', array(
    'defaults' =&gt; 'database',
    'handler' =&gt; array(
        'model' =&gt; 'CustomSession'
    )
));</code>
</pre>
<p>The above will tell CakeSession to use the built in 'database'
defaults, and specify that a model called
<code>CustomSession</code> will be the delegate for saving session
information to the database.</p>
<h3>Cache Sessions</h3>
<p>The Cache class can be used to store sessions as well. This
allows you to store sessions in a cache like APC, memcache, or
Xcache. There are some caveats to using cache sessions, in that if
you exhaust the cache space, sessions will start to expire as
records are evicted.</p>
<p>To use Cache based sessions you can configure you Session config
like:</p>
<pre>
<code>Configure::write('Session', array(
    'defaults' =&gt; 'cache',
    'handler' =&gt; array(
        'config' =&gt; 'session'
    )
));</code>
</pre>
<p>This will configure CakeSession to use the
<code>CacheSession</code> class as the delegate for saving the
sessions. You can use the 'config' key which cache configuration to
use. The default cache configuration is <code>'default'</code>.</p>
<h3>New more granular controls</h3>
<p>In addition to the new approach on session handlers, there are a
few new controls in 2.0. First up is the array of ini settings.
This array allows you to modify and handle ini configurations that
are not afforded by the built in shortcuts. For example you could
use it to control settings like
<code>session.gc_divisor</code>.</p>
<pre>
<code>Configure::write('Session', array(
    'defaults' =&gt; 'php',
    'ini' =&gt; array(
        'session.gc_divisor' =&gt; 1000,
        'session.cookie_httponly' =&gt; true
    )
));</code>
</pre>
<p>Next up is <code>Session.autoRegenerate</code>. This
configuration value was automatically enabled in previous versions
by setting <code>Security.level</code> to high. In 2.0 its an
independent setting, which is disabled by default. Enabling it will
use the session's <code>Config.countdown</code> value to keep track
of requests. Once the countdown reaches 0, the session id will be
regenerated. This is a good option to use for applications that
need the additional security frequently changing session ids
provide. To use this feature set
<code>Session.autoRegenerate</code> to true. You can control the
number of requests needed to regenerate the session by modifying
<code>CakeSession::$requestCountdown</code>.</p>
<h3>Changed methods and APIs</h3>
<h4>CakeSession</h4>
<p>CakeSession is now a fully static class, both
<code>SessionHelper</code> and <code>SessionComponent</code> are
wrappers and sugar for it. It can now easily be used in models or
other contexts. All of its methods are called statically.</p>
<h4>SessionComponent</h4>
<p>Session component has lost the following methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>activate()</li>
<li>active()</li>
<li>__start()</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes include.</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructing the SessionComponent or SessionHelper will start
the session.</li>
</ul>
