<p>Response handling is another subsystem that has received a
significant facelift for CakePHP 2.0. As with request information
and functionality, response related features were spread across
several objects. <code>Controller</code>,
<code>RequestHandler</code> and <code>Dispatcher</code> all had a
slice of the pie. For 2.0 the goal was to consolidate all of that
logic into a single object and make all the previous methods
delegate to this object.</p>
<h3>CakeResponse approach</h3>
<p>When starting to build the new object we looked at the
previously mentioned classes and started pulling out the features
that made sense as a single object. <code>CakeResponse</code>
provides an interface to wrap the common response related tasks
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending headers for redirects.</li>
<li>Sending content type headers.</li>
<li>Sending any header.</li>
<li>Sending the response body.</li>
</ul>
<p>CakePHP uses <code>CakeResponse</code> by default. In general we
aimed to keep <code>CakeResponse</code> a flexible and transparent
to use class. But if you need to replace it with an application
specific class, you can override and replace
<code>CakeResponse</code> with your own class.</p>
<pre>
<code>App::import('Lib', 'CustomResponse');

class AppController extends Controller {
    protected $_responseClass = 'CustomResponse';
}</code>
</pre>
<p>This will make all the controllers in your application use
<code>CustomResponse</code> instead of <code>CakeResponse</code>.
Overriding the response class is useful when testing, as it allows
you to stub out the methods that interact with
<code>header()</code>.</p>
<h3>Using CakeResponse</h3>
<p><code>CakeResponse</code> offers a number of useful methods for
interacting wit the response you are sending to a client. You can
manipulate the headers with several methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>header()</code> Allows you to directly set one or many
headers to be sent with the response.</li>
<li><code>charset()</code> Sets the charset that will be used in
the response.</li>
<li><code>type()</code> Sets the content type for the response. You
can either use a known content type alias or the full content type
name.</li>
<li><code>cache()</code> Allows you to set caching headers in the
response.</li>
<li><code>disableCache()</code> Sets the headers to disable client
caching for the response.</li>
<li><code>compress()</code> Turns on gzip compression for the
request.</li>
<li><code>download()</code> Allows you to send the response as an
attachment and set the filename.</li>
<li><code>statusCode()</code> Allows you to set the status code for
the response.</li>
<li><code>body()</code> Set the content body for the response.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting headers is done with the <code>header()</code> method.
It can be called with a few different parameter configurations:</p>
<pre>
<code>// Set a single header
$this-&gt;response-&gt;header('Location', 'http://example.com');

// Set multiple headers
$this-&gt;response-&gt;header(array('Location' =&gt; 'http://example.com', 'X-Extra' =&gt; 'My header'));
$this-&gt;response-&gt;header(array('WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate', 'Content-type: application/pdf'));</code>
</pre>
<p>Setting the same header multiple times will result in
overwriting the previous values, just like regular header calls.
Headers are not sent when <code>header()</code> is called either.
They are just buffered until the response is actually sent.</p>
<p>In addition to various setter methods that manipulate the
response that will be made to the client, you also can augment the
content types CakeResponse knows about with
<code>type()</code>.</p>
<pre>
<code>// Add a vCard type
$this-&gt;response-&gt;type(array('vcf' =&gt; 'text/v-card'));

// Set the response Content-Type to vcard.
$this-&gt;response-&gt;type('vcf');</code>
</pre>
<p>This makes adding new content types a snap. When you are finally
finished with a response and want to send it to the client you can
call <code>$this-&gt;response-&gt;send();</code> to output all the
headers and body. By default this is done automatically by
<code>Dispatcher</code>.</p>
<h3>CakeResponse and testing</h3>
<p>Probably one of the biggest wins from <code>CakeRequest</code>
comes from how it makes testing controllers and components easier.
Instead of methods spread across several objects, you only have a
single object to mock as controllers and components delegate to
<code>CakeResponse</code>. This helps you get closer to a 'unit'
test and makes testing controllers easier.</p>
<pre>
<code>function testSomething() {
    $this-&gt;controller-&gt;response = $this-&gt;getMock('CakeResponse');
    $this-&gt;controller-&gt;response-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())-&gt;method('header');
    ...
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Additionally you can more easily run tests from the command
line, as you can use mocks to avoid the 'headers sent' errors that
can come up from trying to set headers in CLI.</p>
<h3>CakeResponse and RequestHandler</h3>
<p>As with <code>CakeRequest</code> many of the features
<code>CakeResponse</code> has came from
<code>RequestHandlerComponent</code> and <code>Controller</code>.
For 2.0, RequestHandler will be more of a sugar layer, providing
the same content type magic it has in the past. But now instead of
being directly responsible for setting headers, it delegates out to
the response object. This makes for cleaner code with less
repetition, and hopefully a more extensible and modular
framework.</p>
