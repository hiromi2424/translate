<h2>View Changes in 2.0</h2>
<p>For 2.0 the View layer had a few changes done to help decrease
coupling, and provide greater power and flexibility to
developers.</p>
<h3>Callback positioning changes</h3>
<p>beforeLayout used to fire after <code>scripts_for_layout</code>
and <code>content_for_layout</code> were prepared. In 2.0,
<code>beforeLayout</code> is fired before any of the special
variables are prepared, allowing you to manipulate them before they
are passed to the layout, the same was done for
<code>beforeRender</code>. It is now fired well before any view
variables are manipulated. In addition to these changes, helper
callbacks always receive the name of the file about to be rendered.
This combined with helpers being able to access the view through
<code>$this-&gt;_View</code> and the current view content through
<code>$this-&gt;_View-&gt;content</code> gives you more power than
ever before.</p>
<h3>Helper callback signature changes</h3>
<p>Helper callbacks now always get one argument passed in. For
<code>beforeRender</code> and <code>afterRender</code> it is the
view file being rendered. For <code>beforeLayout</code> and
<code>afterLayout</code> it is the layout file being rendered. Your
helpers function signatures should look like.</p>
<pre>
<code>function beforeRender($viewFile) {

}

function afterRender($viewFile) {

}

function beforeLayout($layoutFile) {

}

function afterLayout($layoutFile) {

}</code>
</pre>
<h3>View::$output</h3>
<p>View will now always have the last rendered content (view or
layout) accessible through <code>$this-&gt;output</code>. In
helpers you can use <code>$this-&gt;_View-&gt;output</code>.
Modifying this property will change the content that comes out of
the view rendering.</p>
<h3>Element caching with Cache class</h3>
<p>Element caching in 2.0 is done with the <code>Cache</code>
class. This allows you to use faster caching storage like APC or
Memcache for frequently used elements. By default View will store
element caches in the <code>default</code> configuration. You can
change the default cache configuration View uses, by setting
<code>$this-&gt;elementCache</code> in your view files. You can
also set caching information per element similar to before.</p>
<pre>
<code>echo $this-&gt;element('side_menu', array('cache' =&gt; true));</code>
</pre>
<p>Would enable caching for an element, and store it in the view
<code>elementCache</code> configuration.</p>
<h4>Changing the cache configuration used for elements</h4>
<p>You can store the cached version of the element into a specific
cache configuration by setting the config value on the cache
parameter.</p>
<pre>
<code>echo $this-&gt;element('side_menu', array('cache' =&gt; array('config' =&gt; 'long_term')));</code>
</pre>
<p>This would store and read the cached version of the element in
the <code>long_term</code> cache. Unlike previous versions, you
cannot directly control the duration of the element cache from the
<code>element()</code> call. Instead you should create the
appropriate cache configurations in your application's
bootstrap.php.</p>
<h4>Creating custom storage keys</h4>
<p>As before you can use custom storage keys for element caching,
if the default ones don't work. By default, View uses the element
name, plugin, and passed param keys as the element cache key. If
this key doesn't give you the uniqueness you need, you can define a
custom key.</p>
<pre>
<code>echo $this-&gt;element('side_menu', array('cache' =&gt; array('key' =&gt; 'my_custom_key_value')));</code>
</pre>
<p>Custom key values are prefixed with <code>element_</code> before
being stored in <code>Cache</code>. This helps namespace them from
other content stored in the cache.</p>
<h3>CacheHelper decoupled</h3>
<p>In previous versions there was a tight coupling between
<code>CacheHelper</code> and <code>View</code>. For 2.0 this
coupling has been removed and <code>CacheHelper</code> just uses
callbacks like other helpers to generate full page caches.</p>
<h4>CacheHelper &lt;cake:nocache&gt; tags changed</h4>
<p>In previous versions, <code>CacheHelper</code> used a special
<code>&lt;cake:noncache&gt;</code> tag as markers for output that
should not be part of the full page cache. These tags were not part
of any XML schema, and were not possible to validate in HTML or XML
documents. For 2.0, these tags have been replaced with HTML/XML
comments.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;cake:noncache&gt;</code> becomes
<code>&lt;!--nocache--&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;/cake:nocache&gt;</code> becomes
<code>&lt;!--/nocache--&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The internal code for full page view caches has also changed, so
be sure to clear out view cache files when updating.</p>
