<h2>Helper, Behavior, Component and Task refactor</h2>
<p>Helpers, behaviors, components, and tasks were restructured for
2.0. After examining the various things these objects did, there
were some striking similarities. All the object types except Tasks
provided callbacks and custom methods. However, the loading and
usage of callbacks was slightly different in each case. For 2.0
these different loading/callback triggering API's were simplified
and made uniform. Using <code>BehaviorCollection</code> as the base
of how things should work. Each object type now has a Collection
object. This collection object is responsible for loading,
unloading and triggering callbacks. The Collection object API looks
like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>load()</code> - Load a new object, and add it to the
collection</li>
<li><code>unload()</code> - Remove an object from the
collection</li>
<li><code>trigger()</code> - Trigger a callback on all objects in
the collection.</li>
<li><code>enable()</code> - Enables a disabled object in the
collection</li>
<li><code>disable()</code> - Disable an object in the
collection</li>
<li><code>attached()</code> - Get the names of the attached
objects, or find out if a specific object is attached.</li>
<li><code>enabled()</code> - Get the names of the enabled objects,
or find out if a specific object is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h3>HelperCollection</h3>
<p>After examining the responsibilities of each class involved in
the View layer, it became clear that View was handling much more
than a single task. The responsibility of creating helpers, is not
central to what View does, and was moved into HelperCollection.
HelperCollection is responsible for loading and constructing
helpers, as well as triggering callbacks on helpers. By default
View creates a HelperCollection in its constructor, and uses it for
subsequent operations. The HelperCollection for a view can be found
at <code>$this-&gt;Helpers</code></p>
<p>The motivations for refactoring this functionality came from a
few issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>View being registered in ClassRegistry could cause registry
poisoning issues when requestAction or the EmailComponent were
used.</li>
<li>View being accessible as a global symbol invited abuse.</li>
<li>Helpers were not self contained. After constructing a helper,
you had to manually construct several other objects in order to get
a functioning object.</li>
</ul>
<p>The refactoring to HelperCollection solved all of the above
issues as well as provided additional new features, such as lazy
loading.</p>
<h3>Using HelperCollection</h3>
<p>HelperCollection provides an API similar to
<code>BehaviorCollection</code>, but for managing helpers.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>load($name, $settings = array())</code> Load is used to
load individual helpers, and provide them with settings.</li>
<li><code>unload($name)</code> Remove a helper from the
collection.</li>
<li><code>attached()</code> Get a list of attached helpers.</li>
<li><code>enabled($name)</code> Get a list of enabled helpers.
Helpers that are not enabled will not have callbacks fired on them.
If a name is passed in a boolean will be returned indicating
whether or not the helper is enabled.</li>
<li><code>enable($name)</code> Re-enables a helper. Enabled helpers
have callbacks fired on them.</li>
<li><code>disable($name)</code> Disables a helper. Disabled helpers
do not have callbacks fired on them.</li>
<li><code>trigger($callback, $params)</code> Trigger a callback on
all the enabled helpers.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the following are run from inside a
view/element/layout.</p>
<h4>Loading helpers on demand in the View</h4>
<p>You can now load individual Helpers on-demand using
<code>View::loadHelper()</code>. This method attaches the Helper to
the HelperCollection and returns the helper as well.</p>
<pre>
$Media = $this-&gt;loadHelper('Media.Media');
// or
$Media = $this-&gt;Helpers-&gt;load('Media');
</pre>
<p>The Media helper will now be inside <code>$Media</code> and
available as <code>$this-&gt;Media</code>. View::loadHelper() is
provided as a wrapper method to be used by helpers to load
additional helpers. Both load methods also takes an array of
settings as the second parameter for helpers that need
configuration arrays.</p>
<h4>Disabling callbacks on a helper</h4>
<pre>
$this-&gt;Helpers-&gt;disable('Html');
</pre>
<p>The HtmlHelper will no longer have view callbacks triggered on
it. You will however be able to use its methods normally.</p>
<h3>View no longer registered in ClassRegistry</h3>
<p>The view being registered ClassRegistry invited abuse and
effectively created a global symbol. In 2.0 each Helper receives
the current <code>View</code> instance in its constructor. This
allows helpers access to the view in a similar fashion as in the
past, without creating global symbols. You can access the view
instance at <code>$this-&gt;_View</code> in any helper.</p>
<h3>Helper constructors changed</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the changes made above, helper
constructors should now have a signature like</p>
<pre>
function __construct(View $View, $settings = array())
</pre>
<p>When overriding the constructor you should always call
<code>parent::__construct</code> as well.
<code>Helper::__construct</code> stores the view instance at
<code>$this-&gt;_View</code> for later reference. The settings are
not handled by the parent constructor.</p>
<h3>Helpers attributes format is more flexible</h3>
<p>The Helper class have more 3 protected attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Helper::_minimizedAttributes</code>: array with minimized
attributes (ie: <code>array('checked', 'selected',
...)</code>);</li>
<li><code>Helper::_attributeFormat</code>: how attributes will be
generated (ie: <code>%s="%s"</code>);</li>
<li><code>Helper::_minimizedAttributeFormat</code>: how minimized
attributes will be generated: (ie <code>%s="%s")</code></li>
</ul>
<p>By default the values used in CakePHP 1.3 do not was changed.
But now you can use boolean attributes from HTML, like
<code>&lt;input type="checkbox" checked /&gt;</code>. To this, just
change <code>$_minimizedAttributeFormat</code> in your AppHelper to
<code>%s</code>.</p>
<p>To use with Html/Form helpers and others, you can write:<br></p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;Form-&gt;checkbox('field', array('checked' =&gt; true, 'value' =&gt; 'some_value'));</code>
</pre>
<p>Other facility is that minimized attributes can be passed as
item and not as key. For example:<br></p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;Form-&gt;checkbox('field', array('checked', 'value' =&gt; 'some_value'));</code>
</pre>
Note that <code>checked</code> have a numeric key.
<h3>Helper of helpers load lazily</h3>
<p>A benefit from using HelperCollection to manage Helpers, is that
Helpers inside helpers now load lazily. This should help create
faster running scripts when all the inner helpers are not accessed.
The first time a helper's helper is accessed it will be
created/loaded from the View's HelperCollection. These changes do
not affect that only one of each helper is loaded per
HelperCollection. As in previous versions of CakePHP, all helpers
of the same name are references to one another.</p>
<h3>View API changes</h3>
<p>As methods were moved around <code>View</code> lost some
methods, and gained a few others.</p>
<h4>Removed methods</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>View::_triggerHelpers()</code> Use
<code>$this-&gt;Helpers-&gt;trigger()</code> instead.</li>
<li><code>View::_loadHelpers()</code> Use
<code>$this-&gt;loadHelpers()</code> instead. Helpers now lazy load
their own helpers now.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Added methods</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>View::loadHelper($name, $settings = array());</code> Load
a single helper.</li>
<li><code>View::loadHelpers()</code> Loads all the helpers
indicated in <code>View::$helpers</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>View-&gt;Helpers</h3>
<p>By default View objects contain a <code>HelperCollection</code>
in <code>$this-&gt;Helpers</code>.</p>
<h2>Component Refactor</h2>
<p>Components were refactored in 2.0 to solve a number of
inconsistencies and provide a more uniform API. In the past
<code>Component</code> was the loader and manager of Components for
a Controller. In 2.0 <code>ComponentCollection</code> takes over
that responsibility and <code>Component</code> is now a base class
for components. This unifies the API between Helpers and Components
as a collection.</p>
<h3>$this-&gt;Component --&gt; $this-&gt;Components</h3>
<p>Inside a controller <code>$this-&gt;Component</code> has been
renamed to <code>$this-&gt;Components</code> this makes it more
uniform with Behaviors and Helpers.
<code>$this-&gt;Components</code> is a ComponentCollection
instance. ComponentCollection provides the following methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>load($name, $settings = array())</code> Load is used to
load individual components, and provide them with settings.</li>
<li><code>unload($name)</code> Remove a component from the
collection.</li>
<li><code>attached()</code> Get a list of attached components.</li>
<li><code>enabled($name)</code> Get a list of enabled components.
Components that are not enabled will not have callbacks fired on
them. If a name is passed in a boolean will be returned indicating
whether or not the component is enabled.</li>
<li><code>enable($name)</code> Re-enables a component. Enabled
components have callbacks fired on them.</li>
<li><code>disable($name)</code> Disables a component. Disabled
components do not have callbacks fired on them.</li>
<li><code>trigger($callback, $params)</code> Trigger a callback on
all the enabled components.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Disabling callbacks on a component</h4>
<pre>
$this-&gt;Components-&gt;disable('Cookie');
</pre>
<p>The CookieComponent will no longer have view callbacks triggered
on it. You will however be able to use its methods normally.</p>
<h3>Deprecated callbacks removed</h3>
<p>All the deprecated callbacks in Component have not been
transferred to ComponentCollection. Instead you should use the
<code>trigger()</code> method to interact with callbacks. If you
need to trigger a callback you could do so by calling</p>
<pre>
$this-&gt;Components-&gt;trigger('someCallback', array(&amp;$this));
</pre>
<p>Keep in mind that all components must implement the callbacks
you want to trigger. If they don't an error will be raised.</p>
<h3>Component as a base class and a new constructor</h3>
<p>All userland components should now extend
<code>Component</code>. In addition if your components declare a
constructor, you should be sure to update that constructor to
reflect the new signature.</p>
<pre>
function __construct(ComponentCollection $collection, $settings = array()) {
    
}
</pre>
<p>As with helpers is important to call
<code>parent::__construct()</code> in components with overridden
constructors. Settings for a component are also passed into the
constructor now, and not the <code>initialize()</code> callback.
This makes getting well constructed objects easier, and allows the
base class to handle setting the properties up.</p>
<p>Since settings have been moved to the component constructor, the
<code>initialize()</code> callback no longer receives
<code>$settings</code> as its 2nd parameter. You should update your
components to use the following method signature:</p>
<pre>
function initialize($controller) { }
</pre>
<p>Additionally, the initialize() method is only called on
components that are enabled. This usually means components that are
directly attached to the controller object.</p>
<h3>Component components are now loaded lazily</h3>
<p>Components used by a Component are now lazy loaded through
<code>__get()</code>. All components of the same name are still
references of each other, and each component will only be
constructed once per request.</p>
<h3>Loading Components on demand</h3>
<p>Much like helpers you can now create Components on demand easily
by using the load method of the ComponentCollection.</p>
<pre>
$Prg = $this-&gt;Components-&gt;load('Prg');
</pre>
<p>By default, all runtime loaded components will have all future
callbacks triggered on them. You can exclude components from
callbacks by either using
<code>$this-&gt;Components-&gt;disable('Prg');</code> or by
including the <code>enabled = false</code> key in your
settings.</p>
<pre>
$Prg = $this-&gt;Components-&gt;load('Prg', array('enabled' =&gt; false));
</pre>
<h4>Changes in disabling components</h4>
<p>In the past you were able to disable components via
<code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;enabled = false;</code> for example. In
CakePHP 2.0 you should use the ComponentCollection's disable
method, <code>$this-&gt;Components-&gt;disable('Auth');</code>.
Using the enabled property will not work properly.</p>
<h3>Task Refactor</h3>
<p>Tasks have also been removed from the ClassRegistry. Instead
Tasks are put into a <code>TaskCollection</code> object attached to
the Shell for a given command. The TaskCollection for a command is
used to load and construct tasks. In addition you can use it to
load tasks at runtime. If you need to access the TaskCollection
inside a shell, use <code>$this-&gt;Tasks-&gt;method()</code>.</p>
<h4>Using plugin tasks</h4>
<p>With TaskCollection, using plugin tasks is quite simple. You
just declare them in the $tasks array like any other Task. The
TaskCollection, will find and construct the desired task. You
should always use the plugin dot syntax to indicate plugin
tasks.</p>
<pre>
public $tasks = array('ProgressBar.Updater');
</pre>
