<p>This page summarises the changes from CakePHP 1.3 that will
assist in a project migration to 2.0, as well as for a developer
reference to get up to date with the changes made to the core since
the CakePHP 1.3 branch. Be sure to read the other pages in this
guide for all the new features and API changes.</p>
<h2>PHP Version Support</h2>
<p>CakePHP 2.x supports PHP Version 5.2.6 and above. PHP4 support
has been dropped.<br>
For developers that are still working with production PHP4
environments, the CakePHP 1.x versions continue to support PHP4 for
the lifetime of their development and support lifetime.</p>
<p>The move to PHP 5 means all methods and properties have been
updated with visibility keywords. If your code is attempting access
to private or protected methods from a public scope, you will
encounter errors.</p>
<p>While this does not really constitute a large framework change,
it means that access to tighter visibility methods and variables is
now not possible.</p>
<h2>Internationalization / Localization</h2>
<p><code>__()</code> (Double underscore shortcut function) always
returns the translation (not echo anymore).</p>
<p>If you want to echo the result of the translation, use:</p>
<pre>
<code>echo __('My Message');</code>
</pre>
<p>This change includes all shortcut translation methods:</p>
<pre>
<code>__( )
__n( )
__d( )
__dn( )
__dc( )
__dcn( )
__c( )</code>
</pre>
<p>Alongside this, if you pass additional parameters, the
translation will call <a href=
"http://php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php">sprintf</a> with
these parameters before returning. For example:</p>
<pre>
<code>// Will return something like "Called: MyClass:myMethod"
echo __('Called: %s:%s', $className, $methodName);</code>
</pre>
<p>It is valid for all shortcut translation methods.</p>
<p>More information about the specifiers, you can see in <a href=
"http://php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php">sprintf
function</a>.</p>
<h2>Renamed files</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>cake/libs/error.php</code> -&gt;
<code>cake/libs/error_handler.php</code></li>
<li><code>cake/console/error.php</code> -&gt;
<code>cake/console/console_error_handler.php</code></li>
<li><code>cake/dispatcher.php</code> -&gt;
<code>cake/libs/dispatcher.php</code></li>
<li><code>cake/console/libs/*</code> -&gt;
<code>cake/console/shells/*</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Class location and constants changed</h2>
<p>Bootstrapping CakePHP no longer uses PHP's
<code>include_path</code> by default any more. Instead you should
define <code>CAKE_CORE_INCLUDE_PATH</code> in
<code>app/webroot/index.php</code>, and
<code>app/webroot/test.php</code>, or use symlinks if you have
CakePHP in a shared directory. You can also use bake to generate
projects with all the paths setup. This change was done primarily
to make the <code>APP_PATH</code> and <code>CORE_PATH</code>
constants have consistent values between the web and console
environments. You can still use PHP's <code>include_path</code> by
setting <code>CAKE_CORE_INCLUDE_PATH</code> to an empty value.</p>
<h2>Basics.php</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>getMicrotime()</code> has been removed. Use the native
<code>microtime(true)</code> instead.</li>
<li><code>e()</code> was removed. Use <code>echo</code>.</li>
<li><code>r()</code> was removed. Use
<code>str_replace</code>.</li>
<li><code>a()</code> was removed. Use <code>array()</code></li>
<li><code>aa()</code> was removed. Use <code>array()</code></li>
<li><code>up()</code> was removed. Use
<code>strtoupper()</code></li>
<li><code>low()</code> was removed. Use
<code>strtolower()</code></li>
<li><code>params()</code> was removed. It was not used anywhere in
CakePHP.</li>
<li><code>ife()</code> was removed. Use a ternary operator.</li>
<li><code>uses()</code> was removed. Use App::import()
instead.</li>
<li>Compatibility functions for PHP4 have been removed.</li>
<li><code>PHP5</code> constant has been removed.</li>
<li>Global var called $TIME_START was removed use
$_SERVER['REQUEST_TIME'] instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CakeRequest</h3>
<p>This new class encapsulates the parameters and functions related
to an incoming request. It replaces many features inside
<code>Dispatcher</code>, <code>RequestHandlerComponent</code> and
<code>Controller</code>. It also replaces
<code>$this-&gt;params</code> array in all places. CakeRequest
implements <code>ArrayAccess</code> so many interactions with the
old params array do not need to change. See the <a href=
"20-cakerequest">CakeRequest new features</a> for
more information.</p>
<h3>Request handling, $_GET['url'] and .htaccess files</h3>
<p>CakePHP no longer uses <code>$_GET['url']</code> for handling
application request paths. Instead it uses
<code>$_SERVER['PATH_INFO']</code>. This provides a more uniform
way of handling requests between servers with URL rewriting and
those without. Because of these changes, you'll need to update your
<code>.htaccess</code> files and
<code>app/webroot/index.php</code>, as these files were changed to
accommodate the changes. Additionally
<code>$this-&gt;params['url']['url']</code> no longer exists.
Instead you should be using <code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;url</code>
to access the same value.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p><code>Component</code> is now the required base class for all
components. See <a href=
"20-helper-behavior-component-and-task-refactor">the
component refactor</a> page for more information.</p>
<h3>AclComponent</h3>
<ul>
<li>AclComponent implementations are now required to implement
<code>AclInterface</code>.</li>
<li>AclComponent::adapter() has been added to allow runtime
modification of the ACL implementation the component uses.</li>
<li>AclComponent::grant() has been deprecated, it will be removed
in a future version. Use AclComponent::allow() instead.</li>
<li>AclComponent::revoke() has been deprecated, it will be removed
in a future version. Use AclComponent::deny() instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>RequestHandlerComponent</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many of RequestHandlerComponent's methods are just proxies for
<code>CakeRequest</code> methods. The following methods have been
deprecated and will be removed in future versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>isSsl()</li>
<li>isAjax()</li>
<li>isPost()</li>
<li>isPut()</li>
<li>isDelete()</li>
<li>getReferer()</li>
<li>getClientIp()</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>accepts(), prefers(), requestedWith() All deal in mapped content
types now. They no longer work with mime-types. You can use
<code>RequestHandler::setContent()</code> to create new content
types.</p>
</li>
<li><code>RequestHandler::setContent()</code> no longer accepts an
array as a single argument, you must supply both arguments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SecurityComponent</h3>
<p>SecurityComponent no longer handles Basic and Digest
Authentication. These are both handled by the new AuthComponent.
The following methods have been removed from SecurityComponent:</p>
<ul>
<li>requireLogin()</li>
<li>generateDigestResponseHash()</li>
<li>loginCredentials()</li>
<li>loginRequest()</li>
<li>parseDigestAuthData()</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition the following properties were removed</p>
<ul>
<li>$loginUsers</li>
<li>$requireLogin</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving these features to AuthComponent was done to provide a
single place for all types of authentication and to streamline the
roles of each component.</p>
<h3>AuthComponent</h3>
<p>The AuthComponent was entirely re-factored for 2.0, this was
done to help reduce developer confusion and frustration. In
addition, AuthComponent was made more flexible and extensible. You
can <a href="20-auth-guide">find out more in the
AuthComponent guide</a></p>
<h2>cakeError removed</h2>
<p>The <code>cakeError()</code> method has been removed. Its
recommended that you switch all uses of <code>cakeError</code> to
<a href="20-exceptions-errors">use exceptions</a>.
<code>cakeError</code> was removed because it was simulating
exceptions. Instead of simulation, real exceptions are used in
CakePHP 2.0</p>
<h2>Error handling</h2>
<p>The error handling implementation has dramatically changed in
2.0. Exceptions have been introduced throughout the framework, and
error handling has been updated to offer more control and
flexibility. You can read more <a href=
"20-exceptions-errors">in the exceptions and error
handling section</a></p>
<h2>Lib classes</h2>
<h3>CakeLog</h3>
<ul>
<li>Log streams now need to implement
<code>CakeLogInterface</code>. Exceptions will be raised if a
configured logger does not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cache</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cache is now a static class, it no longer has a
<code>getInstance()</code> method.</li>
<li>CacheEngine is now an abstract class. You cannot directly
create instances of it anymore.</li>
<li>CacheEngine implementations must extend CacheEngine, exceptions
will be raised if a configured class does not.</li>
<li>FileCache now requires trailing slashes to be added to the path
setting when you are modifying a cache configuration.</li>
<li>Cache no longer retains the name of the last configured cache
engine. This means that operations you want to occur on a specific
engine need to have the $config parameter equal to the config name
you want the operation to occur on.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
    Cache::config('something');
    Cache::write('key, $value);
    
    // would become
    Cache::write('key', $value, 'something');
</pre>
<h3>Router</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can no longer modify named parameter settings with
Router::setRequestInfo(). You should use Router::connectNamed() to
configure how named parameters are handled.</li>
<li>Router no longer has a getInstance() method. It is a static
class, call its methods and properties statically.</li>
<li><code>Router::getNamedExpressions()</code>is deprecated. Use
the new router constants. <code>Router::ACTION</code>,
<code>Router::YEAR</code>, <code>Router::MONTH</code>,
<code>Router::DAY</code>, <code>Router::ID</code>, and
<code>Router::UUID</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dispatcher</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dispatcher has been moved inside of cake/libs, you will have to
update your <code>app/webroot/index.php</code> file.</li>
<li><code>Dispatcher::dispatch()</code> now only accepts a
<code>CakeRequest</code> object or a subclass thereof,</li>
<li><code>Dispather::parseParams()</code> now only accepts a
<code>CakeRequest</code> object.</li>
<li><code>Dispatcher::baseUrl()</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>Dispatcher::getUrl()</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>Dispatcher::uri()</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>Dispatcher::$here</code> has been removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configure</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>Configure::read()</code> with no parameter no longer
returns the value of 'debug' instead it returns all values in
Configure. Use <code>Configure::read('debug');</code> if you want
the value of debug.</li>
<li><code>Configure::load()</code> now requires a ConfigReader to
be setup. Read <a href="20-configure">Configure
updates</a> for more information.</li>
<li><code>Configure::store()</code> now writes values to a given
Cache configuration. Read <a href=
"20-configure">Configure updates</a> for more
information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scaffold</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scaffold 'edit' views should be renamed to 'form'. This was
done to make scaffold and bake templates consistent.
<ul>
<li><code>views/scaffolds/edit.ctp</code> -&gt;
<code>views/scaffolds/form.ctp</code></li>
<li><code>views/posts/scaffold.edit.ctp</code> -&gt;
<code>views/posts/scaffold.form.ctp</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>File</h3>
<ul>
<li>This class has been deprecated, use SplFileObject instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Folder</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>Folder::pwd()</code> has been removed. Use
$folder-&gt;path instead.</li>
<li><code>Folder::read()</code> has been removed. Use
DirectoryIterator instead.</li>
<li><code>Folder::normalizePath()</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>Folder::correctSlashFor()</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>Folder::slashTerm()</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>Folder::isSlashTerm()</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>Folder::addPathElement()</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>Folder::dirsize()</code> renamed to
<code>Folder::dirSize()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Xml</h3>
<ul>
<li>The class Xml was completely re-factored. Now this class does
not manipulate data anymore, and it is a wrapper to
SimpleXMLElement. You can use the follow methods:</li>
<li><code>Xml::build()</code>: static method that you can pass a
xml string, array, path to file or url. The result will be a
SimpleXMLElement instance or an exception will be thrown in case of
error.</li>
<li><code>Xml::fromArray()</code>: static method that returns a
SimpleXMLElement from an array.</li>
<li><code>Xml::toArray()</code>: static method that returns an
array from SimpleXMLElement.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should see the <a href="20-xml">Xml features
page</a> for more information on the changes made to the Xml
class.</p>
<h2>Helpers</h2>
<p>The following properties on helpers are deprecated, you should
use the request object properties or Helper methods instead of
directly accessing these properties as they will be removed in a
future release.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Helper::$webroot</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's webroot property.</li>
<li><code>Helper::$base</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's base property.</li>
<li><code>Helper::$here</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's here property.</li>
<li><code>Helper::$data</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's data property.</li>
<li><code>Helper::$params</code> is deprecated, use the
<code>$this-&gt;request</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AjaxHelper and JavascriptHelper removed</h3>
<p>The AjaxHelper and JavascriptHelper have been removed as they
were deprecated in version 1.3</p>
<p>They are replaced with the JsHelper and HtmlHelper.</p>
<p>Further documentation can be found in the <a href=
"http://book.cakephp.org/view/1561/Migrating-from-CakePHP-1-2-to-1-3"
title="Migrating from CakePHP 1.2 to CakePHP 1.3 Guide">Migrating
from CakePHP 1.2 to CakePHP 1.3 Guide</a></p>
<h3>JsHelper</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>JsBaseEngineHelper</code> is now abstract, you will need
to implement all the methods that previously generated errors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PaginatorHelper</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>PaginatorHelper::sort()</code> now takes the
<code>title</code> and <code>key</code> arguments in the reverse
order. <code>$key</code> will always be first now. This was done to
prevent needing to swap arguments when adding a second one.</li>
<li>PaginatorHelper had a number of changes to the paging params
used internally. The <code>defaults</code> key has been
removed.</li>
<li>PaginatorHelper now supports generating links with paging
parameters in the querystring.</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been a few improvements to pagination in general. For
more information on that you should read the <a href=
"20-pagination">new pagination features
page</a></p>
<h3>FormHelper</h3>
<h4>$selected parameter removed</h4>
<p>The $selected parameter was removed from several methods in
FormHelper. All methods now support a
<code>$attributes['value']</code> key now which should be used in
place of <code>$selected</code>. This change simplifies the
FormHelper methods, reducing the number of arguments, and reduces
the duplication that <code>$selected</code> created. The affected
methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li>FormHelper::select()</li>
<li>FormHelper::dateTime()</li>
<li>FormHelper::year()</li>
<li>FormHelper::month()</li>
<li>FormHelper::day()</li>
<li>FormHelper::hour()</li>
<li>FormHelper::minute()</li>
<li>FormHelper::meridian()</li>
</ul>
<h4>Default urls on forms is the current action</h4>
<p>The default url for all forms, is now the current url including
passed, named, and querystring parameters. You can override this
default by supplying <code>$options['url']</code> in the second
parameter of <code>$this-&gt;Form-&gt;create()</code></p>
<h3>CacheHelper</h3>
<p>CacheHelper has been fully decoupled from View, and uses helper
callbacks to generate caches. You should remember to place
CacheHelper after other helpers that modify content in their
<code>afterRender</code> and <code>afterLayout</code> callbacks. If
you don't some changes will not be part of the cached content.</p>
<p>CacheHelper also no longer uses
<code>&lt;cake:nocache&gt;</code> to indicate un-cached regions.
Instead it uses special HTML/XML comments.
<code>&lt;!--nocache--&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;!--/nocache--&gt;</code>. This helps CacheHelper generate
valid markup and still perform the same functions as before. You
can read more <a href="20-view">CacheHelper and
View changes</a></p>
<h2>Controller</h2>
<ul>
<li>Controller's constructor now takes an optional CakeRequest
object. This object will be used to populate several deprecated
properties and will be set to $request inside the controller.</li>
<li><code>Controller::$webroot</code> is deprecated, use the
request object's webroot property.</li>
<li><code>Controller::$base</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's base property.</li>
<li><code>Controller::$here</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's here property.</li>
<li><code>Controller::$data</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's data property.</li>
<li><code>Controller::$params</code> is deprecated, use the
<code>$this-&gt;request</code> instead.</li>
<li><code>Controller::$Component</code> has been moved to
<code>Controller::$Components</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deprecated properties on Controller will be accessible
through a <code>__get()</code> method. This method will be removed
in future versions, so its recommended that you update your
application.</p>
<p>Controller now defines a maxLimit for pagination. This maximum
limit is set to 100, but can be overridden in the $paginate
options.</p>
<h2>View</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>View::$webroot</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's webroot property.</li>
<li><code>View::$base</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's base property.</li>
<li><code>View::$here</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's here property.</li>
<li><code>View::$data</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's data property.</li>
<li><code>View::$params</code> is deprecated, use the
<code>$this-&gt;request</code> instead.</li>
<li><code>View::$loaded</code> has been removed. Use the <a href=
"20-helper-behavior-component-and-task-refactor">HelperCollection</a>
to access loaded helpers.</li>
<li><code>View::_loadHelpers()</code> has been removed, used
<code>View::loadHelpers()</code> instead.</li>
<li>How <code>View::element()</code> uses caching has changed, see
below for more information.</li>
<li>View callbacks have been shifted around, see below for more
information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deprecated properties on View will be accessible through a
<code>__get()</code> method. This method will be removed in future
versions, so its recommended that you update your application.</p>
<p>Element caching, and view callbacks have been changed in 2.0 to
help provide you with more flexibility and consistency. <a href=
"20-view">Read more about those changes</a></p>
<h2>PHPUnit instead of SimpleTest</h2>
<p>All of the core test cases and supporting infrastructure have
been ported to use PHPUnit 3.5. Of course you can continue to use
SimpleTest in your application by replacing the related files. No
further support will be given for SimpleTest and it is recommended
that you migrate to PHPUnit as well. For some additional
information on how to migrate your tests see <a href=
"phpunit-migration-hints">PHPUnit migration
hints</a></p>
<h3>No more group tests</h3>
<p>PHPUnit does not differentiate between group tests and single
test cases in the runner. Because of this, the group test options,
and support for old style group tests has been removed. It is
recommended that GroupTests be ported to
PHPUnit_Framework_Testsuite subclasses. You can find several
examples of this in CakePHP's test suite. Group test related
methods on <code>TestManager</code> have also been removed.</p>
<h3>Testsuite shell</h3>
<p>The testsuite shell has had its invocation simplified and
expanded. You no longer need to differentiate between
<code>case</code> and <code>group</code>. It is assumed that all
tests are cases. In the past you would have done <code>cake
testsuite app case models/post</code> you can now do <code>cake
testsuite app models/post</code>.</p>
<p>The testsuite shell have been refactored to use the PHPUnit cli
tool, it now support all the command line options supported by
PHPUnit. <code>cake testsuite help</code> will show you a list of
all possible modifiers.</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<p>As now models relationships are lazy loaded. You can run into
situation when assigning a value to an inexistent model property
will throw errors</p>
<pre>
<code>$Post-&gt;inexistentProperty[] = 'value';</code>
</pre>
<p>will throw the error "Notice: Indirect modification of
overloaded property $inexistentProperty has no effect". Assigning
an initial value to the property solves the issue:</p>
<pre>
<code>$Post-&gt;inexistentProperty = array();
$Post-&gt;inexistentProperty[] = 'value';</code>
</pre>
<p>Or just declare the property in the model class:</p>
<pre>
<code>class Post {
    var $inexistantPropert = array();
}</code>
</pre>
<p>Either of these approaches will solve the notice errors.</p>
<p>The notation of find() in Cake 1.2 is no longer supported. Finds
should use notation <code>$model-&gt;find('type',
array(PARAMS))</code> as Cake 1.3.</p>
<h3>Database objets</h3>
<p>DBOs were refactored for this version, being the use of PDO the
major change. Check the <a href=
"http://cakephp.lighthouseapp.com/projects/42648/20-dbo-changes">DBO
changes page</a> for more information</p>
<h3>BehaviorCollection</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>BehaviorCollection</code> no longer
<code>strtolower()</code>'s mappedMethods. Behavior mappedMethods
are now case sensitive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>Plugins no longer magically append their plugin prefix to
components, helpers and models used within them. You must be
explicit with the components, models, and helpers you wish to use.
In the past</p>
<pre>
<code>var $components = array('Session', 'Comments');</code>
</pre>
<p>Would look in the controller's plugin before checking app/core
components, it will now only look in the app/core components. If
you wish to use objects from a plugin you must put the plugin
name.</p>
<pre>
<code>var $components = array('Session', 'Comment.Comments');</code>
</pre>
<p>This was done to reduce hard to debug issues caused by magic
misfiring. It also improves consistency in an application, as
objects have one authoritative way to reference them.</p>
<h2>Console</h2>
<p>Much of the console framework was rebuilt for 2.0 to address
many of the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tightly coupled.</li>
<li>It was difficult to make help text for shells.</li>
<li>Parameters for shells were tedious to validate.</li>
<li>Plugin tasks were not reachable.</li>
<li>Objects with too many responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backwards incompatible Shell API changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shell no longer has an <code>AppModel</code> instance. This
<code>AppModel</code> instance was not correctly built and was
problematic</li>
<li><code>Shell::_loadDbConfig()</code> has been removed. It was
not generic enough to stay in Shell. You can use the
<code>DbConfigTask</code> if you need to ask the user to create a
db config.</li>
<li>Shells no longer use <code>$this-&gt;Dispatcher</code> to
access stdin, stdout, and stderr. They have
<code>ConsoleOutput</code> and <code>ConsoleInput</code> objects to
handle that now.</li>
<li>Shells lazy load tasks, and use <code>TaskCollection</code> to
provide an interface similar to that used for Helpers, Components,
and Behaviors for on the fly loading of tasks.</li>
<li><code>Shell::$shell</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>Shell::_checkArgs()</code> has been removed. Configure a
<code>ConsoleOptionParser</code></li>
<li>Shells no longer have direct access to
<code>ShellDispatcher</code>. You should use the
<code>ConsoleInput</code>, and <code>ConsoleOutput</code> objects
instead. If you need to dispatch other shells, see the section on
'Invoking other shells from your shell'.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backwards incompatible ShellDispatcher API changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>ShellDispatcher</code> no longer has stdout, stdin,
stderr file handles.</li>
<li><code>ShellDispatcher::$shell</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>ShellDispatcher::$shellClass</code> has been
removed.</li>
<li><code>ShellDispatcher::$shellName</code> has been removed.</li>
<li><code>ShellDispatcher::$shellCommand</code> has been
removed.</li>
<li><code>ShellDispatcher::$shellPaths</code> has been removed, use
<code>App::path('shells');</code> instead.</li>
<li>ShellDispatcher no longer uses 'help' as a magic method that
has special status. Instead use the <code>--help/-h</code> options,
and an option parser.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backwards incompatible Shell Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bake's ControllerTask no longer takes <code>public</code> and
<code>admin</code> as passed arguments. They are now options,
indicated like <code>--admin</code> and <code>--public</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Its recommended that you use the help on shells you use to see
what if any parameters have changed. Its also recommended that you
<a href="20-console">read the console new
features</a> for more information on new API's that are
available.</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>The debug() function now defaults to outputting html safe
strings. This is disabled if being used in the console. The
$showHtml option for debug() can be set to false to disable
html-safe output from debug.</p>
