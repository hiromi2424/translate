<p>This page summarises the changes from CakePHP 1.3 that will
assist in a project migration to 2.0, as well as for a developer
reference to get up to date with the changes made to the core since
the CakePHP 1.3 branch.</p> 
<h2>Summary</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>PHP Version Support</li> 
<li>Internationalisation / Localisation</li> 
<li>getMicrotime() Removed</li> 
<li>AjaxHelper and JavascriptHelper removed</li> 
<li>PHPUnit for testing</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>PHP Version Support</h2> 
<p>CakePHP 2.x supports PHP Version 5.2 and above. PHP4 support has
been dropped.<br> 
For developers that are still working with production PHP4
environments, the CakePHP 1.x versions continue to support PHP4 for
the lifetime of their development and support lifetime.</p> 
<p>The move to PHP 5 means all methods and properties have been
updated with visibility keywords. If your code is attempting access
to private or protected methods from a public scope, you will
encounter errors.<br> 
While this does not really constitute a large framework change, it
means that access to tighter visibility methods and variables is
now not possible.</p> 
<h2>Internationalisation / Localisation</h2> 
<p><code>__()</code> (Double underscore shortcut function) now
returns by default.</p> 
<p>This means all code that used:</p> 
<pre> 
<code>__('My Message', true);</code> 
</pre> 
<p>now becomes:</p> 
<pre> 
<code>__('My Message');</code> 
</pre> 
<p>If you want to echo the result of the translation, use:</p> 
<pre> 
<code>echo __('My Message');</code> 
</pre> 
<p>This change includes all shortcut translation methods:<br></p> 
<pre> 
<code><code>__( )
__n( )
__d( )
__dn( )
__dc( )
__dcn( )
__c( )</code></code> 
</pre> 
<h2>Renamed files</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><code>cake/libs/error.php</code> -&gt;
<code>cake/libs/error_handler.php</code></li> 
<li><code>cake/console/error.php</code> -&gt;
<code>cake/console/console_error_handler.php</code></li> 
</ul> 
<h2>Basics.php</h2>

<li>Global var called $TIME_START was removed use
$_SERVER['REQUEST_TIME'] instead.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>CakeRequest</h3> 
<p>This new class encapsulates the parameters and functions related
to an incoming request. It replaces many features inside
<code>Dispatcher</code>, <code>RequestHandlerComponent</code> and
<code>Controller</code>. It also replaces
<code>$this-&gt;params</code> array in all places. CakeRequest
implements <code>ArrayAccess</code> so many interactions with the
old params array do not need to change. See the [CakeRequest new
features](BROKEN LINK) for more information.</p> 
<h2>Components</h2> 
<p><code>Component</code> is now the required base class for all
components. See <a href=
"/projects/42648/20-helper-behavior-component-and-task-refactor">the
component refactor</a> page for more information.</p> 
<h3>AclComponent</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>AclComponent implementations are now required to implement
<code>AclInterface</code>.</li> 
<li>AclComponent::adapter() has been added to allow runtime
modification of the ACL implementation the component uses.</li> 
<li>AclComponent::grant() has been deprecated, it will be removed
in a future version. Use AclComponent::allow() instead.</li> 
<li>AclComponent::revoke() has been deprecated, it will be removed
in a future version. Use AclComponent::deny() instead.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>RequestHandlerComponent</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Many of RequestHandlerComponent's methods are just proxies for
<code>CakeRequest</code> methods. The following methods have been
deprecated and will be removed in future versions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>isSsl()</li> 
<li>isAjax()</li> 
<li>isPost()</li> 
<li>isPut()</li> 
<li>isDelete()</li> 
<li>getReferer()</li> 
<li>getClientIp()</li> 
</ul> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p>accepts(), prefers(), requestedWith() All deal in mapped content
types now. They no longer work with mime-types. You can use
<code>RequestHandler::setContent()</code> to create new content
types.</p> 
</li> 
<li><code>RequestHandler::setContent()</code> no longer accepts an
array as a single argument, you must supply both arguments.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>cakeError removed</h2> 
<p>The <code>cakeError()</code> method has been removed. Its
recommended that you switch all uses of <code>cakeError</code> to
<a href="/projects/42648/20-exceptions-errors">use exceptions</a>.
<code>cakeError</code> was removed because it was simulating
exceptions. Instead of simulation, real exceptions are used in
CakePHP 2.0</p> 
<h2>Error handling</h2> 
<p>The error handling implementation has dramatically changed in
2.0. Exceptions have been introduced throughout the framework, and
error handling has been updated to handle exceptions. You can read
more <a href="/projects/42648/20-exceptions-errors">in the
exceptions and error handling section</a></p> 
<h2>Lib classes</h2> 
<h3>CakeLog</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Log streams now need to implement
<code>CakeLogInterface</code>. Exceptions will be raised if a
configured logger does not.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Cache</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Cache is now a static class, it no longer has a
<code>getInstance()</code> method.</li> 
<li>CacheEngine is now an abstract class. You cannot directly
create instances of it anymore.</li> 
<li>CacheEngine implementations must extend CacheEngine, exceptions
will be raised if a configured class does not.</li> 
<li>FileCache now requires trailing slashes to be added to the path
setting when you are modifying a cache configuration.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Router</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>You can no longer modify named parameter settings with
Router::setRequestInfo();</li> 
<li>Router no longer has a getInstance() method. It is a static
class, call its methods and properties statically.</li> 
<li><code>Router::getNamedExpressions()</code>is deprecated. Use
the new router constants. <code>Router::ACTION</code>,
<code>Router::YEAR</code>, <code>Router::MONTH</code>,
<code>Router::DAY</code>, <code>Router::ID</code>, and
<code>Router::UUID</code> instead.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Dispatcher</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><code>Dispather::parseParams()</code> now only accepts a
<code>CakeRequest</code> object.</li> 
<li><code>Dispatcher::baseUrl()</code> has been removed.</li> 
<li><code>Dispatcher::getUrl()</code> has been removed.</li> 
<li><code>Dispatcher::uri()</code> has been removed.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Configure</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><code>Configure::read()</code> with no parameter no longer
returns the value of 'debug' instead it returns all values in
Configure. Use <code>Configure::read('debug');</code> if you want
the value of debug.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>File</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>This class has been deprecated, use SplFileObject instead.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Folder</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><code>Folder::pwd()</code> has been removed. Use
$folder-&gt;path instead.</li> 
<li><code>Folder::read()</code> has been removed. Use
DirectoryIterator instead.</li> 
<li><code>Folder::normalizePath()</code> has been removed.</li> 
<li><code>Folder::correctSlashFor()</code> has been removed.</li> 
<li><code>Folder::slashTerm()</code> has been removed.</li> 
<li><code>Folder::isSlashTerm()</code> has been removed.</li> 
<li><code>Folder::addPathElement()</code> has been removed.</li> 
<li><code>Folder::dirsize()</code> renamed to
<code>Folder::dirSize()</code>.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Xml</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>The class Xml was completely re-factored. Now this class does
not manipulate data anymore, and it is a wrapper to
SimpleXMLElement. You can use the follow methods:</li> 
<li><code>Xml::build()</code>: static method that you can pass a
xml string, array, path to file or url. The result will be a
SimpleXMLElement instance or an exception will be thrown in case of
error.</li> 
<li><code>Xml::fromArray()</code>: static method that returns a
SimpleXMLElement from an array.</li> 
<li><code>Xml::toArray()</code>: static method that returns an
array from SimpleXMLElement.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The following properties on helpers are deprecated, you should
use the request object properties or Helper methods instead of
directly accessing these properties as they will be removed in a
future release.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><code>Helper::$webroot</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's webroot property.</li>

<h3>AjaxHelper and JavascriptHelper removed</h3> 
<p>The AjaxHelper and JavascriptHelper have been removed as they
were deprecated in version 1.3</p> 
<p>They are replaced with the JsHelper and HtmlHelper.</p> 
<p>Further documentation can be found in the <a href=
"http://book.cakephp.org/view/1561/Migrating-from-CakePHP-1-2-to-1-3"
title="Migrating from CakePHP 1.2 to CakePHP 1.3 Guide">Migrating
from CakePHP 1.2 to CakePHP 1.3 Guide</a></p> 
<h3>JsHelper</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><code>JsBaseEngineHelper</code> is now abstract, you will need
to implement all the methods that previously generated errors.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>Controller</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Controller's constructor now takes an optional CakeRequest
object. This object will be used to populate several deprecated
properties and will be set to $request inside the controller.</li> 
<li><code>Controller::$webroot</code> is deprecated, use the
request object's webroot property.</li> 
<li><code>Controller::$base</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's base property.</li> 
<li><code>Controller::$here</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's here property.</li> 
<li><code>Controller::$data</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's data property.</li> 
<li><code>Controller::$params</code> is deprecated, use the
<code>$this-&gt;request</code> instead.</li> 
<li><code>Controller::$Component</code> has been moved to
<code>Controller::$Components</code>.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The deprecated properties on Controller will be accessible
through a <code>__get()</code> method. This method will be removed
in future versions, so its recommended that you update your
application.</p> 
<h2>View</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><code>View::$webroot</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's webroot property.</li> 
<li><code>View::$base</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's base property.</li> 
<li><code>View::$here</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's here property.</li> 
<li><code>View::$data</code> is deprecated, use the request
object's data property.</li> 
<li><code>View::$params</code> is deprecated, use the
<code>$this-&gt;request</code> instead.</li> 
<li><code>View::$loaded</code> has been removed. Use the <a href=
"/projects/42648/20-helper-behavior-component-and-task-refactor">HelperCollection</a> 
to access loaded helpers.</li> 
<li><code>View::_loadHelpers()</code> has been removed, used
<code>View::loadHelpers()</code> instead.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The deprecated properties on View will be accessible through a
<code>__get()</code> method. This method will be removed in future
versions, so its recommended that you update your application.</p> 
<h2>PHPUnit instead of SimpleTest</h2> 
<p>All of the core test cases and supporting infrastructure have
been ported to use PHPUnit. Of course you can continue to use
SimpleTest in your application by replacing the related files. No
further support will be given for SimpleTest and it is recommended
that you migrate to PHPUnit as well. For some additional
information on how to migrate your tests see <a href=
"/projects/42648/phpunit-migration-hints">PHPUnit migration
hints</a></p> 
<h3>No more group tests</h3> 
<p>PHPUnit does not differentiate between group tests and single
test cases in the runner. Because of this, the group test options,
and support for old style group tests has been removed. It is
recommended that GroupTests be ported to
PHPUnit_Framework_Testsuite subclasses. You can find several
examples of this in CakePHP's test suite. Group test related
methods on <code>TestManager</code> have also been removed.</p> 
<h3>Testsuite shell</h3> 
<p>The testsuite shell has had its invocation simplified and
expanded. You no longer need to differentiate between
<code>case</code> and <code>group</code>. It is assumed that all
tests are cases. In the past you would have done <code>cake
testsuite app case models/post</code> you can now do <code>cake
testsuite app models/post</code>.</p> 
<p>The testsuite shell have been refactored to use the PHPUnit cli
tool, it now support all the command line options supported by
PHPUnit. <code>cake testsuite help&acute; will show you a list of
all possible modifiers.</code></p> 
<h2>Models</h2> 
<p>As now models relationships are lazy loaded you can run into
situation when assigning a value to an inexistent model property
will throw errors</p> 
<pre> 
<code>$Model-&gt;inexistentProperty[] = 'value';</code> 
</pre> 
<p>will throw the error "Notice: Indirect modification of
overloaded property $inexistentProperty has no effect". Assigning
an initial value to the property solves the issue:</p> 
<pre> 
<code>$Model-&gt;inexistentProperty = array();
$Model-&gt;inexistentProperty[] = 'value';</code> 
</pre> 
<h2>BehaviorCollection</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><code>BehaviorCollection</code> no longer
<code>strtolower()</code>'s mappedMethods. Behavior mappedMethods
are now case sensitive.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>Plugins</h2> 
<p>Plugins no longer magically append their plugin prefix to
components, helpers and models used within them. You must be
explicit with the components, models, and helpers you wish to use.
In the past</p> 
<pre> 
<code>var $components = array('Session', 'Comments');</code> 
</pre> 
<p>Would look in the controller's plugin before checking app/core
components, it will now only look in the app/core components. If
you wish to use objects from a plugin you must put the plugin
name.</p> 
<pre> 
<code>var $components = array('Session', 'Comment.Comments');</code> 
</pre> 
<p>This was done to reduce hard to debug issues caused by magic
misfiring. It also improves consistency in an application, as
objects have one authoritative way to reference them.</p>
