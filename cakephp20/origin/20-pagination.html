<p>Pagination has traditionally been a single method in Controller,
this created a number of problems though. Pagination was hard to
extend replace or modify. For 2.0 pagination has been extracted
into a component. Controller::paginate() still exists, and serves
as a convenience method for loading and using the
<code>PaginatorComponent</code>.</p>
<h3>More control over limits and ordering</h3>
<p>You now have better control over the maximum value
<code>limit</code> can be set to. In the past you had to manually
ensure that limit was not increased to an arbitrarily high value.
Now you can set the <code>maxLimit</code> option in your pagination
settings. If the request's limit param is greater than this value,
it will be capped. By default <code>maxLimit</code> is 100.</p>
<p>Columns that are usable for ordering has been improved as well.
In the past <code>Controller::paginate()</code>'s
<code>$whitelist</code> parameter was used to whitelist values that
you passed in. This was not overly productive, so the parameter was
re-purposed to allow developers to define which columns ordering
could be performed on.<br></p>
<pre>
<code> $this-&gt;paginate('Post', array(), array('title', 'slug'));</code>
</pre>
<p>This would allow sorting on the title and slug columns only. A
user that sets <code>sort</code> to any other value will be
ignored. By default sorting is enabled for all columns.</p>
<h3>paginate() and paginateCount() on behaviors</h3>
<p>You can now create <code>paginate()</code> and
<code>paginateCount()</code> on behaviors. This was a commonly
requested feature, and it made sense to implement. Adding this
capability exposed new functionality in <code>Model</code>. You can
now easily check whether or not a model and its behaviors can
handle a method call.</p>
<pre>
<code>if ($this-&gt;Post-&gt;hasMethod('justDoIt')) {
    // do it!
}</code>
</pre>
<p><code>Model::hasMethod()</code> will return true if a model or
its behaviors implements a method. In addition to checking normal
behavior methods, it will also check mappedMethods. Behaviors
implementing <code>paginate()</code> and
<code>paginateCount()</code> should expect the same method
signature as the model counter part, but with an additional
<code>$model</code> param shifted on to the front of the parameter
list.</p>
<h3>Pagination with GET parameters</h3>
<p>In previous versions of CakePHP you could only generate
pagination links using named parameters. But if pages were
requested with GET parameters they would still work. For 2.0, we
decided to make how you generate pagination parameters more
controlled and consistent. You can choose to use either querystring
or named parameters in the component. Incoming requests will accept
only the chosen type, and the <code>PaginatorHelper</code> will
generate links with the chosen type of parameter.</p>
<pre>
<code>var $paginate = array(
    'paramType' =&gt; 'querystring'
);</code>
</pre>
<p>The above would enable querystring parameter parsing and
generation. You can also modify the $settings property on the
PaginatorComponent.</p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;Paginator-&gt;settings['paramType'] = 'querystring';</code>
</pre>
<p>By default all the typical paging parameters will be converted
into querystring arguments, when querystring arguments are used. If
you want to force other routing parameters to be treated as
querystring parameters you can use
<code>$this-&gt;Paginator-&gt;options(array('convertKeys' =&gt;
array('your', 'keys', 'here)));</code>.</p>
<h3>Additional rel attributes on generated links</h3>
<p>The links generated by <code>first()</code>,
<code>last()</code>, <code>next()</code> and <code>prev()</code>
all include rel attributes with the appropriate values.</p>
