<p>In 2.0 Configure is able to load configuration files from a
number of different sources. No longer are you forced to use PHP
files, in the exact format the Configure used in the past. You can
use either of the built-in config readers or create your own.</p>
<h3>Built-in config file readers</h3>
<p>CakePHP comes with two built-in configuration file readers.
<code>PhpReader</code> is able to read PHP config files, in the
same format that Configure has historically read.
<code>IniReader</code> is able to read ini config files. See the
<a href="http://php.net/parse_ini_file">PHP documentation</a> for
more information on the specifics of ini files. To use a core
config reader, you'll need to attach it to Configure:</p>
<pre>
<code>App::import('Core', 'config/PhpReader');
// Read config files from app/config
Configure::config('default', new PhpReader());

// Read config files from another path.
Configure::config('default', new PhpReader('/path/to/your/config/files/'));</code>
</pre>
<p>You can have multiple readers attached to Configure, each
reading different kinds of configuration files, or reading from
different types of sources. You can interact with attached readers
using a few other methods on Configure. To see check which reader
aliases are attached you can use
<code>Configure::configured()</code></p>
<pre>
<code>// Get the array of aliases for attached readers.
Configure::configured()

// Check if a specific reader is attached
Configure::configured('default');</code>
</pre>
<p>You can also remove attached readers.
<code>Configure::drop('default')</code> would remove the default
reader alias, and any future attempts to load configuration files
with that reader would fail.</p>
<h3>Loading configuration</h3>
<p>Once you've attached a config reader to Configure you can load
configuration files:</p>
<pre>
<code>// Load my_file.php using the 'default' reader object.
Configure::load('my_file', 'default');</code>
</pre>
<p>Loaded configuration files merge their data with the existing
runtime configuration in Configure. This allows you to overwrite
and add new values into the existing runtime configuration.</p>
<h3>Storing runtime configuration</h3>
<p>You can also store runtime configuration values for use in a
future request. Since configure only remembers values for the
current request, you will need to store any modified configuration
information if you want to use it in subsequent requests.</p>
<pre>
<code>// Store the current configuration in the 'user_1234' key in the 'default' cache.
Configure::store('user_1234', 'default');</code>
</pre>
<p>Stored configuration data is persisted in the Cache class. This
allows you to store Configuration information in any storage engine
that Cache can talk to.</p>
<h3>Restoring runtime configuration</h3>
<p>Once you've stored runtime configuration, you'll probably need
to restore it so you can access it again.
<code>Configure::restore()</code> does exactly that.</p>
<pre>
<code>// restore runtime configuration from the cache.
Configure::restore('user_1234', 'default');</code>
</pre>
<p>When restoring configuration information its important to
restore it with the same key, and cache configuration as was used
to store it. Restored information is merged on top of the existing
runtime configuration.</p>
<h3>Creating your own Configuration readers</h3>
<p>Since configuration readers are an extensible part of CakePHP,
you can create configuration readers in your application and
plugins. Configuration readers need to implement the
<code>ConfigReaderInterface</code>. This interface defines a read
method, as the only required method. If you really like XML files,
you could create a simple Xml config reader for you
application.</p>
<pre>
<code>// in app/libs/config/xml_reader.php
App::import('Core', 'Xml');
class XmlReader implements ConfigReaderInterface {
    function __construct($path = CONFIGS) {
        $this-&gt;_path = $path;
    }

    function read($key) {
        $xml = Xml::build($this-&gt;_path . $key . '.xml');
        return Xml::toArray($xml);
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>In your <code>app/config/bootstrap.php</code> you could attach
this reader and use it.</p>
<pre>
<code>App::import('Libs', 'config/XmlReader');
Configure::config('xml', new XmlReader());
...

Configure::load('my_xml');</code>
</pre>
<p>The <code>read()</code> method of a config reader, must return
an array of the configuration information that the resource named
<code>$key</code> contains.</p>
