<p>In previous versions request parameters were just a bunch of
arrays that were copied to the various places they were needed in
the framework. Methods related to request features were spread
across <code>RequestHandler</code>, <code>Router</code>,
<code>Dispatcher</code> and <code>Controller</code>. There was no
authoritative object on what information the request contained. In
many other frameworks the request is represented by a single
object. This seemed like and excellent solution for CakePHP that
would allow us to both consolidate the existing code, and provide
some useful new features.</p>
<h2>CakeRequest</h2>
<p><code>CakeRequest</code> is the default request object used in
CakePHP 2.0. It centralizes the many features available in the
classes previously mentioned into a single object. This object is
then passed by reference to the various objects that use request
data. This makes changes to that object reflect uniformly across
all references. Some of the duties <code>CakeRequest</code>
performs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process the GET, POST, and FILES arrays into the data
structures you are familiar with.</li>
<li>Provide environment introspection pertaining to the request.
Things like the headers sent, the client's IP address, and the
subdomain/domain information about the application the server is
running on.</li>
<li>Provide access to request parameters both as array indices and
object properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>The request object is available in all the objects that used to
have a <code>params</code> property. The params property still
exists and contains the request object, but its been deprecated in
favour of <code>$this-&gt;request</code>. I think this gives easier
to read code than <code>params</code> does, and more accurately
reflects what it does.</p>
<h2>Getting at params with CakeRequest</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned <code>CakeRequest</code> can be accessed
in an array fashion, like the old <code>params</code> property was
or, you can use object property access. Since both these interfaces
existed on controllers in previous versions, both interfaces were
moved to the request object.</p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;request['controller'];
$this-&gt;request-&gt;controller;</code>
</pre>
<p>Will both access the same values. The two ways of accessing
values was done to ease the transition to using CakeRequest. In
addition to the normal route parameters, properties like
<code>base</code>, <code>webroot</code>, and <code>here</code> were
also moved off the controller and into the request object. These
properties were again things that had been spread about the
framework, but belonged with the request object.</p>
<h2>Checking the request</h2>
<p>Detecting various request conditions used to require using
<code>RequestHandlerComponent</code>. These methods have been moved
to <code>CakeRequest</code>, and offer a new interface alongside a
more backwards compatible usage:</p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;is('post');
$this-&gt;request-&gt;isPost();</code>
</pre>
<p>Both method calls will return the same value. For the time being
the methods are still available on RequestHandler, but are
deprecated and still might be removed before the final release. You
can also easily extend the request detectors that are available, by
using <code>CakeRequest::addDetector()</code> to create new kinds
of detectors. There are four different types of detectors that you
can create:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment value comparison - An environment value comparison,
compares a value fetched from <code>env()</code> to a known value
the environment value is equality checked against the provided
value.</li>
<li>Pattern value comparison - Pattern value comparison allows you
to compare a value fetched from <code>env()</code> to a regular
expression.</li>
<li>Option based comparison - Option based comparisons use a list
of options to create a regular expression. Subsequent calls to add
an already defined options detector will merge the options.</li>
<li>Callback detectors - Callback detectors allow you to provide a
'callback' type to handle the check. The callback will receive the
request object as its only parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples would be:</p>
<pre>
<code>// Add a environment detector.
$this-&gt;request-&gt;addDetector('post', array('env' =&gt; 'REQUEST_METHOD', 'value' =&gt; 'POST'));

// Add a pattern value detector.
$this-&gt;request-&gt;addDetector('iphone', array('env' =&gt; 'HTTP_USER_AGENT', 'pattern' =&gt; '/iPhone/i'));

// Add an option detector
$this-&gt;request-&gt;addDetector('internalIp', array(
    'env' =&gt; 'CLIENT_IP', 
    'options' =&gt; array('192.168.0.101, '192.168.0.100')
));

// Add a callback detector. Can either be an anonymous function or a regular callable.
$this-&gt;request-&gt;addDetector('awesome', function ($request) {
    return isset($request-&gt;awesome);
});</code>
</pre>
<p><code>CakeRequest</code> also includes methods like
<code>domain()</code>, <code>subdomains()</code> and
<code>host()</code> to help applications with subdomains, have a
slightly easier life.</p>
<h2>CakeRequest and RequestHandlerComponent</h2>
<p>Since many of the features <code>CakeRequest</code> offers used
to be the realm of <code>RequestHandlerComponent</code> some
rethinking was required to figure out how it still fits into the
picture. I was never really happy with having to use a component
that did many things on top of request introspection just to get
the request introspection. For 2.0,
<code>RequestHandlerComponent</code> acts as a sugar daddy.
Providing a layer of sugar on top of the utility
<code>CakeRequest</code> affords. Sugar like switching layout and
views based on content types or ajax is the domain of
<code>RequestHandlerComponent</code>. This separation of utility
and sugar between the two classes lets you more easily pick and
choose what you want and what you need.</p>
<h2>Interacting with other aspects of the request</h2>
<p>You can use <code>CakeRequest</code> to introspect a variety of
things about the request. Beyond the detectors, you can also find
out other information from various properties and methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;webroot</code> contains the webroot
directory.</li>
<li><code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;base</code> contains the base
path.</li>
<li><code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;here</code> contains the request
uri for the current request.</li>
<li><code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;query</code> contains the query
string parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CakeRequest methods</h3>
<p><strong>domain()</strong></p>
<p>Returns the domain name your application is running on.</p>
<p><strong>subdomains()</strong></p>
<p>Returns the subdomains your application is running on as an
array.</p>
<p><strong>host()</strong></p>
<p>Returns the host your application is on.</p>
<p><strong>method()</strong></p>
<p>Returns the HTTP method the request was made with.</p>
<p><strong>referer()</strong></p>
<p>Returns the referring address for the request.</p>
<p><strong>clientIp()</strong></p>
<p>Returns the current visitors IP address.</p>
<p><strong>header()</strong></p>
<p>Allows you to access any of the <code>HTTP_*</code> headers that
were used for the request.</p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;header('User-Agent');</code>
</pre>
<p>Would return the user agent used for the request.</p>
<p><strong>data()</strong></p>
<p>Provides dot notation access to request data. Allows for reading
and modification of request data, calls can be chained together as
well.</p>
<pre>
<code>// Modify some request data, so you can prepopulate some form fields.
$this-&gt;request-&gt;data('Post.title', 'New post')
    -&gt;data('Comment.1.author', 'Mark');

// You can also read out data.
$value = $this-&gt;request-&gt;data('Post.title');</code>
</pre>
