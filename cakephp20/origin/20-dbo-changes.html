<h1>DBO Changes</h1>
<p>Cake 2.0 introduces some changes to Database objects that should
not greatly affect backwards compatibility, the biggest one is the
adoption of PDO for handling database connections, if you are using
a vanilla installation of PHP 5 you will already have installed the
needed extensions, but you may need to activate individual
extensions for each driver you wish to use.</p>
<p>Using PDO across all DBOs let us homogenize the code for each
one and provide a more reliable and predictable behavior for all
drivers. It also allowed us to write more portable and accurate
tests for database related code.</p>
<p>The first thing users will probably miss is the "affected rows"
and "total rows" statistics, as they are not reported due to the
more performant and lazy design of PDO, there are way to overcome
this issue but is very specific to each database. Those statistics
are not gone, though, but could be missing or even inaccurate for
some drivers.</p>
<p>A nice feature added after the PDO adoption is the ability of
using prepared statements with query placeholders using the native
driver if available.</p>
<h2>List of Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>DboMysqli was removed, we will support DboMysql only</li>
<li>
<p>API for DboSource::execute has changed, it will now take an
array of query values as second parameter:</p>
<pre>
<code>public function execute($sql, $params = array(), $options = array())</code>
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>became</p>
<pre>
<code>    public function execute($sql, $options = array(), $params = array())</code>
</pre>
<p>third parameter is meant to receive options for logging,
currently it only understands the "log" option</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DboSource::value() looses it's third parameter, it was not used
anyways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DboSource::fetchAll() now accepts an array as second parameter,
to pass values to be bound to the query, third parameter was
dropped. Example:</p>
<pre>
<code>$db-&gt;fetchAll('SELECT * from users where username = ? AND password = ?', array('jhon', '12345'));
$db-&gt;fetchAll('SELECT * from users where username = :username AND password = :password', array('username' =&gt; 'jhon', 'password' =&gt; '12345'));</code>
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>The PDO driver will automatically escape those values for
you</p>
<ul>
<li>Database statistics are collected only if the "fullDebug"
property of the correspondent DBO is set to true</li>
<li>New method DboSource::getConnection() will return the PDO
object in case you need to talk to the driver directly</li>
<li>Treatment of boolean values changed a bit to make it more
cross-database friendly, you may need to change your test
cases</li>
<li>Postgresql support was immensely improved, it now correctly
creates schemas, truncate tables, and is easier to write tests
using it</li>
<li>DboSource::insertMulti() will no longer accept sql string, just
pass an array of fields and a nested array of values to insert them
all at once</li>
<li>TranslateBehavior was refactored to use model virtualFields,
this makes the implementation more portable</li>
<li>All tests cases with Mysql related stuff were moved to the
correspondent driver test case, this left the DboSourceTest file a
bit skinny</li>
<li>Transaction nesting support. Now it is possible to start a
transaction several times. It will only be committed if the commit
method is called the same amount of times</li>
<li>Sqlite support was greatly improved. The major difference with
cake 1.3 is that in will only support Sqlite 3.x . It is a great
alternative for development apps, and quick running test
cases.</li>
<li>Boolean column values will be casted to php native boolean type
automatically, so make sure you update you test cases and code if
you were expecting the returned value to be a string or an integer:
I you had a "published" column in the past using mysql all values
returned from a find would be numeric on the past, now they are
strict boolean values.</li>
</ul>
