<p><strong>Error Handling</strong></p>
<p>Subclasses of ErrorHandler can more easily implement additional
error methods. In the past you would need to override
<code>__construct()</code> and work around ErrorHandler's desire to
convert all error methods into <code>error404</code> when debug =
0. In 1.3 error methods that are declared in subclasses are not
converted to <code>error404</code>. If you want your error methods
converted into error404, then you will need to do it manually.</p>


<p><strong>Scaffolding</strong></p>
<p>With the addition of <code>Routing.prefixes</code> scaffolding
has been updated to allow the scaffolding of any one prefix.</p>
<pre>
Configure::write('Routing.prefixes', array('admin', 'member'));

class PostsController extends AppController {
    var $scaffold = 'member';
}
</pre>
<p>Would use scaffolding for member prefixed urls.</p>




<p><strong>Validation</strong></p>
<p>After 1.2 was released there were numerous requests to add
additional localizations to the <code>phone()</code> and
<code>postal()</code> methods. Instead of trying to add every
locale to Validation itself, which would result in large bloated
ugly methods, and still not afford the flexibility needed for all
cases, an alternate path was taken. In 1.3 <code>phone()</code> and
<code>postal()</code> will pass off any country prefix it does not
know how to handle to another class with the appropriate name. For
example if you lived in the Netherlands you would create a class
like</p>
<pre>
class NlValidation {
    function phone($check) {
        ...
    }
    function postal($check) {
        ...
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This file could be placed anywhere in your application, but must
be imported before attempting to use it. In your model validation
you could use your NlValidation class by doing the following.</p>
<pre>
var $validate = array(
    'phone_no' => array('rule' => array('phone', null, 'nl')),
    'postal_code' => array('rule' => array('postal', null, 'nl'))
);
</pre>

<p>When your model data is validated, Validation will see that it
cannot handle the 'nl' locale and will attempt to delegate out to
<code>NlValidation::postal()</code> and the return of that method
will be used as the pass/fail for the validation. This approach
allows you to create classes that handle a subset or group of
locales, something that a large switch would not have. The usage of
the individual validation methods has not changed, the ability to
pass off to another validator has been added.</p>


<p><strong>IP Address Validation</strong></p>
<p>Validaiton of IP Addresses has been extended to allow strict
validation of a specific IP Version. It will also make use of PHP
native validation mechanisms if available.</p>
<pre>
Validation::ip($someAddress);         // Validates both IPv4 and IPv6
Validation::ip($someAddress, 'IPv4'); // Validates IPv4 Addresses only
Validation::ip($someAddress, 'IPv6'); // Validates IPv6 Addresses only
</pre>


<p><strong>Valdation::uuid()</strong></p>
<p>A uuid() pattern validation has been added to the
<code>Validation</code> class. It will check that a given string
matches a uuid by pattern only. It does not ensure uniqueness of
the given uuid.</p>
