<p><strong>Router</strong></p>
<p>Generating urls with new style prefixes works exactly the same
as admin routing did in 1.2. They use the same syntax and
persist/behave in the same way. Assuming you have
<code>Configure::write('Routing.prefixes', array('admin',
'member'));</code> in your core.php you will be able to do the
following from a non-prefixed url:</p>
<pre>
$this->Html->link('Go', array('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'index', 'member' => true));
$this->Html->link('Go', array('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'index', 'admin' => true));
</pre>
<p>Likewise, if you are in a prefixed url and want to go to a
non-prefixed url, do the following:</p>
<pre>
$this->Html->link('Go', array('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'index', 'member' => false));
$this->Html->link('Go', array('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'index', 'admin' => false));
</pre>

<p><strong>Route classes</strong></p>
<p>For 1.3 the router has been internally rebuilt, and a new class
<code>CakeRoute</code> has been created. This class handles the
parsing and reverse matching of an individual connected route. Also
new in 1.3 is the ability to create and use your own Route classes.
You can implement any special routing features that may be needed
in application routing classes. Developer route classes must extend
<code>CakeRoute</code>, if they do not an error will be triggered.
Commonly a custom route class will override the
<code>parse()</code> and/or <code>match()</code> methods found in
<code>CakeRoute</code> to provide custom handling.</p>

<p><strong>Dispatcher</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accessing filtered asset paths, while having no defined asset
filter will create 404 status code responses.</li>
</ul>
