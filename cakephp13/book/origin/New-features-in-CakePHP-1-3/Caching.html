<p>Cache engines have been made more flexible in 1.3. You can now
provide custom <code>Cache</code> adapters in <code>app/libs</code>
as well as in plugins using <code>$plugin/libs</code>. App/plugin
cache engines can also override the core engines. Cache adapters
must be in a cache directory. If you had a cache engine named
<code>MyCustomCacheEngine</code> it would be placed in either
<code>app/libs/cache/my_custom_cache.php</code> as an app/libs. Or
in <code>$plugin/libs/cache/my_custom_cache.php</code> as part of a
plugin. Cache configs from plugins need to use the plugin dot
syntax.</p>
<pre>
Cache::config('custom', array(
    'engine' => 'CachePack.MyCustomCacheEngine',
    ...
));
</pre>


<p><strong>New Cache methods</strong></p>
<p>Cache has a few new methods for 1.3, the make introspection and
testing teardown easier.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Cache::configured()</code> returns an array of configured
Cache engine keys.</li>
<li><code>Cache::drop($config)</code> drops a configured Cache
engine. Once dropped cache engines are no longer readable or
writeable.</li>
<li><code>Cache::increment()</code> Perform an atomic increment on
a numeric value. This is not implemented in FileEngine.</li>
<li><code>Cache::decrement()</code> Perform an atomic decrement on
a numeric value. This is not implemented in FileEngine.</li>
</ul>
