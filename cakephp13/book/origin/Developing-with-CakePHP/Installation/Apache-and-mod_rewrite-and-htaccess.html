<p>While CakePHP is built to work with mod_rewrite out of the box–and usually does–we've noticed that a few users struggle with getting everything to play nicely on their systems. </p>
<p>Here are a few things you might try to get it running correctly. First look at your httpd.conf (Make sure you are editing the system httpd.conf rather than a user- or site-specific httpd.conf).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure that an .htaccess override is allowed and that AllowOverride is set to All for the correct DocumentRoot. You should see something similar to:</p>
<pre>
#
# Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect
# to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled in that
# directory (and its subdirectories). 
#
# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of 
# features.  
#
<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
#    Order deny,allow
#    Deny from all
</Directory>
</pre></li>
<li><p>Make sure you are loading up mod_rewrite correctly. You should see something like:</p>
<pre>LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so</pre>

<p>In many systems these will be commented out (by being prepended with a #) by default, so you may just need to remove those leading # symbols.</p>
<p>After you make changes, restart Apache to make sure the settings are active.</p>
Verify that you your .htaccess files are actually in the right directories.<p></p> This can happen during copying because some operating systems treat files that start with '.' as hidden and therefore won't see them to copy. </li>
<li><p>Make sure your copy of CakePHP is from the downloads section of the site or our GIT repository, and has been unpacked correctly by checking for .htaccess files.</p>
<p>Cake root directory (needs to be copied to your document, this redirects everything to your Cake app):</p>
<pre>
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
   RewriteEngine on
   RewriteRule    ^$ app/webroot/    [L]
   RewriteRule    (.*) app/webroot/$1 [L]
</IfModule>
</pre>
<p>Cake app directory (will be copied to the top directory of your application by bake):</p>
<pre>
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule    ^$    webroot/    [L]
    RewriteRule    (.*) webroot/$1    [L]
 </IfModule>
</pre>
<p>Cake webroot directory (will be copied to your application's web root by bake):</p>
<pre>
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
</IfModule>
</pre>
<p>For many hosting services (GoDaddy, 1and1), your web server is actually being served from a user directory that already uses mod_rewrite. If you are installing CakePHP into a user directory (http://example.com/~username/cakephp/), or any other URL structure that already utilizes mod_rewrite, you'll need to add RewriteBase statements to the .htaccess files CakePHP uses (/.htaccess, /app/.htaccess, /app/webroot/.htaccess). </p>
<p>This can be added to the same section with the RewriteEngine directive, so for example your webroot .htaccess file would look like:<p>
<pre>
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
</IfModule>
</pre>
<p>The details of those changes will depend on your setup, and can include additional things that are not Cake related. Please refer to Apache's online documentation for more information.</p></li>
