<title>Common options</title>
<p>In attempts to simplify development where Js libraries can
change, a common set of options is supported by
<code>JsHelper</code>, these common options will be mapped out to
the library specific options internally. If you are not planning on
switching Javascript libraries, each library also supports all of
its native callbacks and options.</p>
