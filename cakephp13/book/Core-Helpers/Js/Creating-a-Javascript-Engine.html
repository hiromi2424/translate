<title>Creating a Javascript Engine</title>
<p>Javascript engine helpers follow normal helper conventions, with
a few additional restrictions. They must have the
<code>Engine</code> suffix. <code>DojoHelper</code> is not good,
<code>DojoEngineHelper</code> is correct. Furthermore, they should
extend <code>JsBaseEngineHelper</code> in order to leverage the
most of the new API.</p>
