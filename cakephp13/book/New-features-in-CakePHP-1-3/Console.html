<p><strong>Bake</strong></p>
<p>Bake has had a number of significant changes made to it. Those
changes are detailed in <a href=
"/view/1611/Bake-improvements-in-1-3">the bake updates
section</a></p>


<p><strong>Subclassing</strong></p>
<p>The ShellDispatcher has been modified to not require shells and
tasks to have <em>Shell</em> as their immediate parent anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<p><code>Shell::nl()</code> has been added. It returns a single or
multiple linefeed sequences. <code>Shell::out()</code>,
<code>err()</code> and <code>hr()</code> now accept a
<code>$newlines</code> parameter which is passed to
<code>nl()</code> and allows for controlling how newlines are
appended to the output.</p>
<p><code>Shell::out()</code> and <code>Shell::err()</code> have
been modified, allowing a parameterless usage. This is especially
useful if you're often using <code>$this-&gt;out('')</code> for
outputting just a single newline.</p>
<p><strong>Acl Shell</strong></p>
<p>All AclShell commands now take <code>node</code> parameters.
<code>node</code> parameters can be either an alias path like
<code>controllers/Posts/view</code> or Model.foreign_key ie.
<code>User.1</code>. You no longer need to know or use the aco/aro
id for commands.</p>
<p>The Acl shell <code>dataSource</code> switch has been removed.
Use the Configure settings instead.</p>

<p><strong>SchemaShell</strong></p>
<p>The Schema shell can now read and write Schema files and SQL
dumps to plugins. It expects and will create schema files in
<code>$plugin/config/schema</code></p>
