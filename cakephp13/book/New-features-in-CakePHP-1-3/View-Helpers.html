<p>Helpers can now be addressed at
<code>$this-&gt;Helper-&gt;func()</code> in addition to
<code>$helper-&gt;func()</code>. This allows view variables and
helpers to share names and not create collisions.</p>
<p><strong>New JsHelper and new features in HtmlHelper</strong></p>
<p>See <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/1592/Js">JsHelper documentation</a> for
more information</p>
<p><strong>Pagination Helper</strong></p>
<p>Pagination helper provides additional css classes for styling
and you can set the default sort() direction.
<code>PaginatorHelper::next()</code> and
<code>PaginatorHelper::prev()</code> now generate span tags by
default, instead of divs.</p>

<p><strong>Helper</strong></p>
<p><code>Helper::assetTimestamp()</code> has been added. It will
add timestamps to any asset under WWW_ROOT. It works with
<code>Configure::read('Asset.timestamp');</code> just as before,
but the functionality used in Html and Javascript helpers has been
made available to all helpers. Assuming <code>Asset.timestamp ==
force</code></p>
<pre>
$path = 'css/cake.generic.css'
$stamped = $this->Html->assetTimestamp($path);

//$stamped contains 'css/cake.generic.css?5632934892'
</pre>
<p>The appended timestamp contains the last modification time of
the file. Since this method is defined in <code>Helper</code> it is
available to all subclasses.</p>


<p><strong>TextHelper</strong></p>
<p>highlight() now accepts an array of words to highlight.</p>
<p><strong>NumberHelper</strong></p>
<p>A new method <code>addFormat()</code> has been added. This
method allows you to set currency parameter sets, so you don't have
to retype them.</p>
<pre>
$this->Number->addFormat('NOK', array('before' => 'Kr. '));
$formatted = $this->Number->currency(1000, 'NOK');
</pre>

<p><strong>FormHelper</strong></p>
<p>The form helper has had a number of improvements and API
modifications, see <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/1616/x1-3-improvements">Form Helper improvements</a> for more information.</p>
