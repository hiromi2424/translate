<title>Using a specific Javascript engine</title>
<p>First of all download your preferred javascript library and place it in <code>app/webroot/js</code></p>

<p>Then you must include the library in your page. To include it in all
pages, add this line to the &lt;head&gt; section of 
<code>app/views/layouts/default.ctp</code> (copy this file from
<code>cake/libs/view/layouts/default.ctp</code> if you have not created
your own).</p>

<p><pre>
echo $this->Html->script('jquery'); // Include jQuery library
</pre></p>

<p>Replace <code>jquery</code> with the name of your library file (.js will be added to the name).</p>

<p>By default scripts are cached, and you must explicitly print out the cache. To do this at the end of each page, include this line just before the ending 
<code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag</p>
<p><pre>
echo $js->writeBuffer(); // Write cached scripts
</pre></p>

<p>Javascript engine selection is declared when you include the
helper in your controller.</p>
<p><pre>
var $helpers = array('Js' => array('Jquery'));
</pre></p>

<p>The above would use the Jquery Engine in the instances of
JsHelper in your views. If you do not declare a specific engine,
the jQuery engine will be used as the default. As mentioned before,
there are three engines implemented in the core, but we encourage
the community to expand the library compatibility.</p>
