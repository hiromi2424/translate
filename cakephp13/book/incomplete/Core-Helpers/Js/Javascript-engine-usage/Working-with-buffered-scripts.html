<tile>Working with buffered scripts</title>
<p>One drawback to previous implementation of 'Ajax' type features
was the scattering of script tags throughout your document, and the
inability to buffer scripts added by elements in the layout. The
new JsHelper if used correctly avoids both of those issues. It is
recommended that you place <code>$js-&gt;writeBuffer()</code> at
the bottom of your layout file above the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
tag. This will allow all scripts generated in layout elements to be
output in one place. It should be noted that buffered scripts are
handled separately from included script files.</p>

<p class="method">writeBuffer($options = array())</p>
<p>Writes all Javascript generated so far to a code block or caches
them to a file and returns a linked script.</p>

<p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>inline</code> - Set to true to have scripts output as a
script block inline if <code>cache</code> is also true, a script
link tag will be generated. (default true)</li>
<li><code>cache</code> - Set to true to have scripts cached to a
file and linked in (default false)</li>
<li><code>clear</code> - Set to false to prevent script cache from
being cleared (default true)</li>
<li><code>onDomReady</code> - wrap cached scripts in domready event
(default true)</li>
<li><code>safe</code> - if an inline block is generated should it
be wrapped in &lt;![CDATA[ ... ]]&gt; (default true)</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a cache file with <code>writeBuffer()</code> requires
that <code>webroot/js</code> be world writable and allows a browser
to cache generated script resources for any page.</p>

<p class='method'>buffer($content)</p>
<p>Add <code>$content</code> to the internal script buffer.</p>

<p class="method">getBuffer($clear = true)</p>
<p>Get the contents of the current buffer. Pass in false to not
clear the buffer at the same time.</p>
