<title>Making Ajax Links</title>
<p>Before you can create ajax links you must include the Javascript
library that matches the adapter you are using with
<code>JsHelper</code>. By default the <code>JsHelper</code> uses
jQuery. So in your layout include jQuery (or whichever library you
are using)</p>
<pre>
echo $this->Html->script('jquery');
</pre>
<p>Similar to 1.2 you need to tell the <code>PaginatorHelper</code>
that you want to make Javascript enhanced links instead of plain
HTML ones. To do so you use <code>options()</code></p>
<pre>
$this->Paginator->options(array(
    'update' => '#content',
    'evalScripts' => true
));
</pre>
<p>The <code>PaginatorHelper</code> now knows to make javascript
enhanced links, and that those links should update the
<code>#content</code> element. Of course this element must exist,
and often times you want to wrap <code>$content_for_layout</code>
with a div matching the id used for the <code>update</code> option.
You also should set <code>evalScripts</code> to true if you are
using the Mootools or Prototype adapters, without
<code>evalScripts</code> these libraries will not be able to chain
requests together. The <code>indicator</code> option is not
supported by <code>JsHelper</code> and will be ignored.</p>
<p>You then create all the links as needed for your pagination
features. Since the <code>JsHelper</code> automatically buffers all
generated script content to reduce the number of
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags in your source code you
<strong>must</strong> call write the buffer out. At the bottom of
your view file. Be sure to include:</p>
<pre>
echo $this->Js->writeBuffer();
</pre>
<p>If you omit this you will <strong>not</strong> be able to chain
ajax pagination links. When you write the buffer, it is also
cleared, so you don't have worry about the same Javascript being
output twice.</p>
