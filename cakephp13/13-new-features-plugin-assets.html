      <div><h2>Plugin and Theme assets</h2>
<p>New for 1.3 is an improved and simplified plugin + theme webroot
directory. In the past plugins could have a vendors directory
containing <code>img</code>, <code>js</code>, and <code>css</code>.
Each of these directories could only contain the type of file they
shared a name with. And theme assets needed to be separated from
their theme and added to <code>app/webroot/themed</code>. In 1.3
both plugins and themes can have a <code>webroot</code> directory.
This directory should contain any and all public accessible files
for your plugin or theme.</p>
<pre>
<code>app/plugins/debug_kit/webroot/
                                css/
                                js/
                                img/
                                flash/
                                pdf/</code>
</pre>
<p>And so on. You are no longer restricted to the three directories
in the past, and you may put any type of file in any directory,
just like a regular webroot. The only restriction is that
<code>MediaView</code> needs to know the mime-type of that
asset.</p>
<h3>Linking to assets in plugins</h3>
<p>The urls to plugin assets remains the same. In the past you used
<code>/debug_kit/js/my_file.js</code> to link to
<code>app/plugins/debug_kit/vendors/js/my_file.js</code>. It now
links to
<code>app/plugins/debug_kit/webroot/js/my_file.js</code></p>
<h4>Upgrading plugin assets.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a <code>$plugin/webroot</code></li>
<li>Copy files from vendors/css, vendors/js, and vendors/img to the
respective dirs in <code>webroot</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Vendor assets</h3>
<p>Support for vendor assets have been removed for 1.3. It is
recommended that you take any vendor assets you have and repackage
them into plugins.</p>
<h3>Theme assets</h3>
<p>In previous versions themes needed to be split into their view
and asset parts. New for 1.3 is a webroot directory as part of a
theme. This webroot directory can contain any static assets that
are included as part of your theme.</p>
<h4>Linking to assets in themes</h4>
<p>Linking to static assets is slightly different from 1.2. You can
still use the existing <code>app/webroot/themed</code> and directly
link to those static files. It should be noted that you will need
to use the <strong>full</strong> path to link to assets in
<code>app/webroot/themed</code>. If you want to keep your theme
assets inside app/webroot it is recommended that you rename
<code>app/webroot/themed</code> to <code>app/webroot/theme</code>.
This will allow you to leverage the core helper path finding. As
well as keep the performance benefits of not serving assets through
PHP.</p>
<p>If you want to use the new theme webroot - which the core
helpers support by default - you can do so by making paths like
<code>theme/&lt;theme_name&gt;/&lt;path_to_file&gt;</code>. The
Dispatcher will handle finding the correct theme in your view
paths.</p>
<h4>Using theme views to override plugin views.</h4>
<p>You can use a theme to override a plugins built in views as
well. This has changed slightly from 1.2 so be sure to check that
you have the correct paths. If you had a theme named
<code>shiny</code> and a plugin named <code>blogs</code> you could
override the blogs plugin views in your shiny theme by creating
view files at <code>app/views/themed/shiny/plugins/blogs/*</code>.
This directory could contain directories for any controllers +
views you wish to override. For example:</p>
<pre>
<code>// theme view file
app/views/themed/shiny/plugins/blogs/posts/view.ctp

//overrides 
app/plugins/blogs/views/posts/view.ctp</code>
</pre>
<h4>Increasing performance of plugin and theme assets</h4>
<p>Its a well known fact that serving assets through PHP is
guaranteed to be slower than serving those assets without invoking
PHP. And while the core team has taken steps to make plugin and
theme asset serving as fast as possible, there may be situations
where more performance is required. In these situations its
recommended that you either symlink or copy out plugin/theme assets
to directories in <code>app/webroot</code> with paths matching
those used by cakephp.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>app/plugins/debug_kit/webroot/js/my_file.js</code>
becomes <code>app/webroot/debug_kit/js/my_file.js</code></li>
<li><code>app/views/themed/navy/webroot/css/navy.css</code> becomes
<code>app/webroot/theme/navy/css/navy.css</code></li>
</ul>
