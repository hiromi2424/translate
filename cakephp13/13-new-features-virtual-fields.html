      <div><h1>Model virtual fields</h1>
<p>Virtual fields are a new feature in the Model for CakePHP 1.3.
Virtual fields allow you to create arbitrary SQL expressions and
assign them as fields in a Model. These fields cannot be saved, but
will be treated like other model fields for read operations. They
will be indexed under the model's key alongside other model
fields.</p>
<h2>How to create virtual fields</h2>
<p>Creating virtual fields is easy. In each model you can define a
<code>$virtualFields</code> property that contains an array of
field =&gt; expressions. An example of virtual field definitions
would be:</p>
<pre>
<code class="php">var $virtualFields = array(
    'name' =&gt; 'CONCAT(User.first_name, ' ', User.last_name)'
);</code>
</pre>
<p>In subsequent find operations, your User results would contain a
<code>name</code> key with the result of the concatenation. It is
not advisable to create virtual fields with the same names as
columns on the database, this can cause SQL errors.</p>
<h2>Using virtual fields</h2>
<p>Creating virtual fields is straightforward and easy, interacting
with virtual fields can be done through a few different
methods.</p>
<h3>Model::hasField()</h3>
<p>Model::hasField() has been updated so that it can will return
true if the model has a virtualField with the correct name. By
setting the second parameter of hasField to true, virtualFields
will also be checked when checking if a model has a field. Using
the example field above,</p>
<pre>
<code class=
"php">$this-&gt;User-&gt;hasField('name'); // Will return false, as there is no concrete field called name
$this-&gt;User-&gt;hasField('name', true); // Will return true as there is a virtual field called name</code>
</pre>
<h3>Model::isVirtualField()</h3>
<p>This method can be used to check if a field/column is a virtual
field or a concrete field. Will return true if the column is
virtual.</p>
<pre>
<code class="php">$this-&gt;User-&gt;isVirtualField('name'); //true
$this-&gt;User-&gt;isVirtualField('first_nname'); //false</code>
</pre>
<h3>Model::getVirtualField()</h3>
<p>This method can be used to access the SQL expression that
comprises a virtual field. If no argument is supplied it will
return all virtual fields in a Model.</p>
<pre>
<code class=
"php">$this-&gt;User-&gt;getVirtualField('name'); //returns 'CONCAT(User.first_name, ' ', User.last_name)'</code>
</pre>
<h3>Model::find() and virtual fields</h3>
<p>As stated earlier <code>Model::find()</code> will treat virtual
fields much like any other field in a model. The value of a virtual
field will be placed under the model's key in the resultset. Unlike
the behavior of calculated fields in 1.2</p>
<pre>
<code class="php">$results = $this-&gt;User-&gt;find('first');

// results contains the following
array(
    'User' =&gt; array(
        'first_name' =&gt; 'Mark',
        'last_name' =&gt; 'Story',
        'name' =&gt; 'Mark Story',
        //more fields.
    )
);</code>
</pre>
<h3>Pagination and virtual fields</h3>
<p>Since virtual fields behave much like regular fields when doing
find's, <code>Controller::paginate()</code> has been updated to
allows sorting by virtual fields.</p>
