      <div><h2>bake updates for 1.3</h2>
<p>For 1.3 bake has had a significant overhaul, and a number of
features and enhancements have been built in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two new tasks (FixtureTask and TestTask) are accessible from
the main bake menu</li>
<li>A third task (TemplateTask) has been added for use in your
shells.</li>
<li>All the different bake tasks now allow you to use connections
other than default for baking. Using the <code>-connection</code>
parameter.</li>
<li>Plugin support has been greatly improved. You can use either
<code>-plugin PluginName</code> or <code>Plugin.class</code>.</li>
<li>Questions have been clarified, and made easier to
understand.</li>
<li>Multiple validations on models has been added.</li>
<li>Self Associated models using <code>parent_id</code> are now
detected. For example if your model is named Thread, a ParentThread
and ChildThread association will be created.</li>
<li>Fixtures and Tests can be baked separately.</li>
<li>Baked Tests include as many fixtures as they know about,
including plugin detection (plugin detection does not work on
PHP4).</li>
</ul>
<p>So with the laundry list of features, we'll take some time to
look at some of the new commands, new parameters and updated
features.</p>
<h3>New FixtureTask, TestTask and TemplateTask.</h3>
<p>Fixture and test baking were a bit of a pain in the past. You
could only generate tests when baking the classes, and fixtures
could only be generated when baking models. This made adding tests
to your applications later or even regenerating fixtures with new
schemas a bit painful. For 1.3 we've separated out Fixture and Test
making them separate tasks. This allows you to re-run them and
regenerate tests and fixtures at any point in your development
process.</p>
<p>In addition to being rebuildable at any time, baked tests are
now attempt to find as many fixtures as possible. In the past
getting into testing often involved fighting through numerous
'Missing Table' errors. With more advanced fixture detection we
hope to make testing easier and more accessible.</p>
<p>Test cases also generate skeleton test methods for every
non-inherited public method in your classes. Saving you one extra
step.</p>
<p><code>TemplateTask</code> is a behind the scenes task, and it
handles file generation from templates. In previous versions of
CakePHP baked views were template based, but all other code was
not. With 1.3 almost all the content in the files generated by bake
are controlled by templates and the <code>TemplateTask</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>FixtureTask</code> not only generates fixtures with
dummy data, but using the interactive options or the
<code>-records</code> option you can enable fixture generation
using live data.</p>
<h3>New bake commands.</h3>
<p>New commands have been added to make baking easier and faster.
Controller, Model, View baking all feature an <code>all</code>
subcommand, that builds everything at once and makes speedy
rebuilds easy.</p>
<pre>
<code class="php"> cake bake model all</code>
</pre>
<p>Would bake all the models for an application in one shot.
Similarly <code>cake bake controller all</code> would bake all
controllers and <code>cake bake view all</code> would generate all
view files. Parameters on the <code>ControllerTask</code> have
changed as well. <code>cake bake controller scaffold</code> is now
<code>cake bake controller public</code>. <code>ViewTask</code> has
had an <code>-admin</code> flag added, using <code>-admin</code>
will allow you to bake views for actions that begin with
<code>Routing.admin</code></p>
<p>As mentioned before <code>cake bake fixture</code> and
<code>cake bake test</code> are new, and have several subcommands
each. <code>cake bake fixture all</code> will regenerate all the
basic fixtures for your application. The <code>-count</code>
parameter allows you to set the number of fake records that are
created. By running fixture task interactively you can generate
fixtures using the data in your live tables. You can use <code>cake
bake test &lt;type&gt; &lt;class&gt;</code> to create test cases
for already created objects in your app. Type should be one of the
standard CakePHP types ('component', 'controller', 'model',
'helper', 'behavior') but doesn't have to be. Class should be an
existing object of the chosen type.</p>
<h3>Templates Galore</h3>
<p>New in bake for 1.3 is the addition of more templates. In 1.2
baked views used templates that could be changed to modify the view
files bake generated. In 1.3 templates are used to generate all
output from bake. There are separate templates for controllers,
controller action sets, fixtures, models, test cases, and the view
files from 1.2. As well as more templates, you can also have
multiple template sets or, bake themes. Bake themes can be provided
in your app, or as part of plugins. An example plugin path for bake
theme would be
<code>app/plugins/bake_theme/vendors/shells/templates/dark_red/</code>.
An app bake theme called <code>blue_bunny</code> would be placed in
<code>app/vendors/shells/templates/blue_bunny</code>. You can look
at <code>cake/console/templates/default/</code> to see what
directories and files are required of a bake theme. However, like
view files, if your bake theme doesn't implement a template, other
installed themes will be checked until the correct template is
found.</p>
<h3>Additional plugin support.</h3>
<p>New in 1.3 are additional ways to specify plugin names when
using bake. In addition to <code>cake bake plugin Todo controller
Posts</code>, there are two new forms. <code>cake bake controller
Todo.Posts</code> and <code>cake bake controller Posts -plugin
Todo</code>. The plugin parameter can be while using interactive
bake as well. <code>cake bake controller -plugin Todo</code>, for
example will allow you to use interactive bake to add controllers
to your Todo plugin. Additional / multiple plugin paths are
supported as well. In the past bake required your plugin to be in
app/plugins. In 1.3 bake will find which of the pluginPaths the
named plugin is located on, and add the files there.</p>
<p>Well I hope you find the enhancements to bake as useful and
exciting as I do. I feel they make bake an even more powerful and
flexible tool in the rapid development of your applications.</p>
