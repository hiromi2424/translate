      <div><h2>Logging enhancements</h2>
<p><code>CakeLog</code> the default logging solution in CakePHP has
been enhanced to provide a more flexible logging for 1.3. In
addition to the default file logging, you can extend the logging by
configuring additional log streams. Log streams can be provided as
part of plugins or be part of your app.</p>
<h3>Creating and configuring log streams</h3>
<p>Log stream handlers can be part of your application, or part of
plugins. If for example you had a database logger called
<code>DatabaseLogger</code>. As part of your application it would
be placed in <code>app/libs/log/database_logger.php</code>. As part
of a plugin it would be placed in
<code>app/plugins/my_plugin/libs/log/database_logger.php</code>.
When configured <code>CakeLog</code> will attempt to load
Configuring log streams is done by calling
<code>CakeLog::config()</code>. Configuring our DatabaseLogger
would look like</p>
<pre>
<code class="php">//for app/libs
CakeLog::config('otherFile', array(
    'engine' =&gt; 'DataBaseLogger',
    'model' =&gt; 'LogEntry',
    ...
));

//for plugin called LoggingPack
CakeLog::config('otherFile', array(
    'engine' =&gt; 'LoggingPack.DataBaseLogger',
    'model' =&gt; 'LogEntry',
    ...
));</code>
</pre>
<p>When configuring a log stream the <code>engine</code> parameter
is used to locate and load the log handler. All of the other
configuration properties are passed to the log stream's constructor
as an array.</p>
<pre>
<code class="php">class DatabaseLogger {
    function __construct($options = array()) {
        //...
    }
}</code>
</pre>
<p>CakePHP has no requirements for Log streams other than that they
must implement a <code>write</code> method. This write method must
take two parameters <code>$type, $message</code> in that order.
<code>$type</code> is the string type of the logged message, core
values are <code>error</code>, <code>warning</code>,
<code>info</code> and <code>debug</code>. In addition you can
define your own types by using them when you call
<code>CakeLog::write</code>.</p>
<h3>Interacting with log streams</h3>
<p>You can introspect the configured streams with
<code>CakeLog::configured()</code>. The return of
<code>configured()</code> is an array of all the currently
configured streams. You can remove streams using
<code>CakeLog::drop($key)</code>. Once a log stream has been
dropped it will no longer receive messages.</p>
<h3>Writing to the log streams</h3>
<p>All log streams are written to sequentially each time
<code>CakeLog::write()</code> is called. You do not need to
configure a stream in order to use logging. If no streams are
configured when the log is written to, a <code>default</code>
stream using the core <code>FileLog</code> class will be configured
to output into <code>app/tmp/logs/</code> just as CakeLog did in
CakePHP 1.2</p>
<h3>Error Logging</h3>
<p>Errors are now logged when <code>Configure::write('debug',
0);</code>. You can use <code>Configure::write('log', $val)</code>,
to control which errors are logged when debug is off. By default
all errors are logged.</p>
<pre>
<code class="php">Configure::write('log', E_WARNING);</code>
</pre>
<p>Would log only warning and fatal errors. Setting
<code>Configure::write('log', false);</code> will disable error
logging when debug = 0.</p>
