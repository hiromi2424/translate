      <div><h1>Test Suite Changes</h1>
<p>The TestSuite harness for 1.3 was heavily refactored and
partially rebuilt. The number of constants and global functions
have been greatly reduced. Also the number of classes used by the
test suite has been reduced and refactored. You
<strong>must</strong> update <code>app/webroot/test.php</code> to
continue using the test suite. We hope that this will be the last
time that a change is required to
<code>app/webroot/test.php</code>.</p>
<h2>New reporter system</h2>
<p>Reporters generate the visible output from the test suite. In
1.2 there were only two options for Reporters: Text and Html. There
was no easy way to extend or enhance the reporters without
modifying core files. In 1.3 you can create your own reporters by
creating files in your app/libs. For example you could create the
file <code>app/libs/test_suite/reporters/my_reporter.php</code> and
in it create the following</p>
<pre>
<code>require_once CAKE_TEST_LIB . 'reporter' . DS . 'cake_base_reporter.php';

class MyReporter extends CakeBaseReporter {

}</code>
</pre>
<p>Extending <code>CakeBaseReporter</code> or one of its subclasses
is not required, but strongly suggested as you may get missing
errors otherwise. <code>CakeBaseReporter</code> encapsulates a few
common test suite features such as test case timing and code
coverage report generation. You can use your custom reporter by
setting the <code>output</code> query string parameter to the
reporter name minus 'reporter'. For the example above you would set
<code>output=my</code> to use your custom reporter.</p>
<h2>Removed classes constants and global functions</h2>
<p>The following constants, global functions and classes have been
removed as part of the refactoring:</p>
<h3>Constants</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>CAKE_TEST_OUTPUT</code></li>
<li><code>RUN_TEST_LINK</code></li>
<li><code>BASE</code></li>
<li><code>CAKE_TEST_OUTPUT_TEXT</code></li>
<li><code>CAKE_TEST_OUTPUT_HTML</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These constants have all been replaced with instance variables
on the reporters and the ability to switch reporters.</p>
<h3>Global functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>CakePHPTestHeader()</code></li>
<li><code>CakePHPTestSuiteHeader()</code></li>
<li><code>CakePHPTestSuiteFooter()</code></li>
<li><code>CakeTestsGetReporter()</code></li>
<li><code>CakePHPTestRunMore()</code></li>
<li><code>CakePHPTestAnalyzeCodeCoverage()</code></li>
<li><code>CakePHPTestGroupTestList()</code></li>
<li><code>CakePHPTestCaseList()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These methods and the logic they contained have been
refactored/rewritten into <code>CakeTestSuiteDispatcher</code> and
the relevant reporter classes. This made the test suite more
modular and easier to extend.</p>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<ul>
<li>HtmlTestManager</li>
<li>TextTestManager</li>
<li>CliTestManager</li>
</ul>
<p>These classes became obsolete as logic was consolidated into the
reporter classes.</p>
<h2>Modified methods/classes</h2>
<p>The following methods have been changed as noted.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TestManager::getExtension()</code> is no longer
static.</li>
<li><code>TestManager::runAllTests()</code> is no longer
static.</li>
<li><code>TestManager::runGroupTest()</code> is no longer
static.</li>
<li><code>TestManager::runTestCase()</code> is no longer
static.</li>
<li><code>TestManager::getTestCaseList()</code> is no longer
static.</li>
<li><code>TestManager::getGroupTestList()</code> is no longer
static.</li>
</ul>
<h2>testsuite Console changes</h2>
<p>The output of errors, exceptions, and failures from the
testsuite console tool have been updated to remove redundant
information and increase readability of the messages. If you have
other tools built upon the testsuite console, be sure to update
those tools with the new formatting.</p>
<h2>CodeCoverageManager changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>CodeCoverageManager::start()</code>'s functionality has
been moved to <code>CodeCoverageManager::init()</code></li>
<li><code>CodeCoverageManager::start()</code> now starts coverage
generation.</li>
<li><code>CodeCoverageManager::stop()</code> pauses collection</li>
<li><code>CodeCoverageManager::clear()</code> stops and clears
collected coverage reports.</li>
</ul>
