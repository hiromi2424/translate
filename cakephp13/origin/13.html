      <div><h2>CakePHP 1.3</h2>
<p>CakePHP is the version of CakePHP that follows 1.2. It has a
slightly larger version number and more delicious goodness baked
in. Although, not at a stable release, we've started documentation
and migration guides for adventurous folk. Since 1.3 is a minor
release, we've tried to make the upgrade path as painless as
possible.</p>
<h3>Migrating from 1.2 to 1.3</h3>
<p>If you wish to upgrade an existing application from 1.2 to 1.3,
then you should read the upgrade guide .</p>
<h3>Delicious shiny new icing</h3>

added to 1.3 you should read The new features overview</p>
