      <div><h2>新しいJs Helper</h2>
<p>The Js helper has been rebuilt and redesigned for 1.3. It along
with methods in HtmlHelper, are aimed to fully replace the
JavascriptHelper &amp; AjaxHelpers.</p>
<h3>New HtmlHelper methods</h3>
<p>HtmlHelper has inherited the Html generating methods from the
JavascriptHelper. The following methods have been added into
HtmlHelper.</p>
<h4>HtmlHelper::script($script, $options = array())</h4>
<p>Include a script file into the page.
<code>$options['inline']</code> controls whether or not a script
should be returned inline or added to $scripts_for_layout.
<code>$options['once']</code> controls, whether or not you want to
include this script once per request or more than once.</p>
<pre>
<code class="php">echo $html-&gt;script('mootools');</code>
</pre>
<p>You can also use $options to set additional properties to the
generated script tag. If an array of script tags is used, the
attributes will be applied to all of the generated script tags.</p>
<h4>HtmlHelper::scriptBlock($code, $options = array())</h4>
<p>Generate a code block containing <code>$code</code> set
<code>$options['inline']</code> to false to have the script block
appear in <code>$scripts_for_layout</code>. Also new is the ability
to add attributes to script tags.
<code>$html-&gt;scriptBlock('stuff', array('defer' =&gt;
true));</code> will create a script tag with
<code>defer="defer"</code> attribute.</p>
<h4>HtmlHelper::scriptStart($options = array())</h4>
<p>Begin a buffering code block. This code block will capture all
output between <code>scriptStart()</code> and
<code>scriptEnd()</code> and create an script tag. Options are the
same as <code>scriptBlock()</code></p>
<h4>HtmlHelper::scriptEnd()</h4>
<p>End a buffering script block, returns the generated script
element or null if the script block was opened with inline =
false.</p>
<p>An example of using <code>scriptStart()</code> and
<code>scriptEnd()</code> would be:</p>
<pre>
<code class=
"php">$html-&gt;scriptStart(array('inline' =&gt; false));

echo $js-&gt;alert('I am in the javascript');

$html-&gt;scriptEnd();</code>
</pre>
<h3>JsHelper ideology</h3>
<p>Since the beginning CakePHP's support for Javascript has been
with Prototype/Scriptaculous. While we still think these are an
excellent Javascript library, the community has been asking for
support for other libraries. Rather than drop Prototype in favour
of another Javascript library. We created an Adapter based helper,
and included 3 of the most requested libraries.
Prototype/Scriptaculous, Mootools/Mootools-more, and jQuery/jQuery
UI. And while the API is not as expansive as the previous
AjaxHelper we feel that the adapter based solution allows for a
more extensible solution giving developers the power and
flexibility they need to address their specific application
needs.</p>
<p>Javascript Engines form the backbone of the new JsHelper. A
Javascript engine translates an abstract Javascript element into
concrete Javascript code specific to the Javascript library being
used. In addition they create an extensible system for others to
use.</p>
<h4>Using a specific Javascript Engine</h4>
<p>Javascript engine selection is declared when you include the
helper in your controller.</p>
<pre>
<code class=
"php">var $helpers = array('Js' =&gt; array('Prototype'));</code>
</pre>
<p>The above would use the Prototype Engine in the instances of
JsHelper in your views. If you do not declare a specific engine,
the jQuery engine will be used as the default. As mentioned before,
there are three engines implemented in the core, but we encourage
the community to expand the library compatibility.</p>
<h4>Creating a Javascript Engine Helper</h4>
<p>Javascript engine helpers follow normal helper conventions, with
a few additional restrictions. They must have the
<code>Engine</code> suffix. <code>DojoHelper</code> is not good,
<code>DojoEngineHelper</code> is correct. Furthermore, they should
extend <code>JsBaseEngineHelper</code> in order to leverage the
most of the new API.</p>
<h3>JsHelper and JsBaseEngineHelper API</h3>
<p>The <code>JsHelper</code> provides a few methods, and acts as a
facade for the the Engine helper. You should not directly access
the Engine helper except in rare occasions. Using the facade
features of the <code>JsHelper</code> allows you to leverage the
buffering and method chaining features built-in; (method chaining
only works in PHP5).</p>
<h4>Buffering scripts</h4>
<p>The <code>JsHelper</code> by default buffers almost all script
code generated, allowing you to collect scripts throughout the
view, elements and layout, and output it in one place. Outputting
buffered scripts is done with <code>$js-&gt;writeBuffer();</code>
this will return the buffer contents in a script tag. You can
disable buffering wholesale with the <code>$bufferScripts</code>
property or setting <code>buffer =&gt; false</code> in methods
taking <code>$options</code>.</p>
<h4>Method chaining (PHP5 only)</h4>
<p>Since most methods in Javascript begin with a selection of
elements in the DOM, <code>$js-&gt;get()</code> returns a $this,
allowing you to chain the methods using the selection.</p>
<pre>
<code class=
"php">$js-&gt;get('#foo')-&gt;event('click', $eventCode);</code>
</pre>
<p>Is an example of method chaining. Method chaining is not
possible in PHP4 and the above sample would be written like</p>
<pre>
<code class="php">$js-&gt;get('#foo');
$js-&gt;event('click', $eventCode);</code>
</pre>
<h4>Common options</h4>
<p>In attempts to simplify development where Js libraries can
change, a common set of options is supported by
<code>JsHelper</code>, these common options will be mapped out to
the library specific options internally. If you are not planning on
switching Javascript libraries, each library also supports all of
its native callbacks and options.</p>
<h4>Callback wrapping</h4>
<p>By default all callback options are wrapped with the an
anonymous function with the correct arguments. You can disable this
behavior by supplying the <code>wrapCallbacks = false</code> in
your options array.</p>
<h3>Using JsHelper</h3>
<p>JsHelper offers two sub API's, the first is related to buffering
and handling of scripts, the other is the cross-library Javascript
generation API.</p>
<h4>Working with buffered scripts</h4>
<p>One drawback to previous implementation of 'Ajax' type features
was the scattering of script tags throughout your document, and the
inability to buffer scripts added by elements in the layout. The
new JsHelper if used correctly avoids both of those issues. It is
recommended that you place <code>$js-&gt;writeBuffer()</code> at
the bottom of your layout file above the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
tag. This will allow all scripts generated in layout elements to be
output in one place. It should be noted that buffered scripts are
handled separately from included script files.</p>
<h4>writeBuffer($options = array())</h4>
<p>Writes all Javascript generated so far to a code block or caches
them to a file and returns a linked script.</p>
<h4>Options</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>inline</code> - Set to true to have scripts output as a
script block inline if <code>cache</code> is also true, a script
link tag will be generated. (default true)</li>
<li><code>cache</code> - Set to true to have scripts cached to a
file and linked in (default false)</li>
<li><code>clear</code> - Set to false to prevent script cache from
being cleared (default true)</li>
<li><code>onDomReady</code> - wrap cached scripts in domready event
(default true)</li>
<li><code>safe</code> - if an inline block is generated should it
be wrapped in &lt;![CDATA[ ... ]]&gt; (default true)</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a cache file with <code>writeBuffer()</code> requires
that <code>webroot/js</code> be world writable and allows a browser
to cache generated script resources for any page.</p>
<h4>buffer($content)</h4>
<p>Add <code>$content</code> to the internal script buffer.</p>
<h4>getBuffer($clear = true)</h4>
<p>Get the contents of the current buffer. Pass in false to not
clear the buffer at the same time.</p>

<h3>Ajax Pagination with JsHelper</h3>
<p>Much like Ajax Pagination in 1.2, you can use the JsHelper to
handle the creation of Ajax pagination links instead of plain HTML
links.</p>
<h4>Making ajax links</h4>
<p>Before you can create ajax links you must include the Javascript
library that matches the adapter you are using with
<code>JsHelper</code>. By default the <code>JsHelper</code> uses
jQuery. So in your layout include jQuery (or whichever library you
are using)</p>
<pre>
<code>echo $this-&gt;Html-&gt;script('jquery');</code>
</pre>
<p>Similar to 1.2 you need to tell the <code>PaginatorHelper</code>
that you want to make Javascript enhanced links instead of plain
HTML ones. To do so you use <code>options()</code></p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;Paginator-&gt;options(array(
    'update' =&gt; '#content',
    'evalScripts' =&gt; true
));</code>
</pre>
<p>The <code>PaginatorHelper</code> now knows to make javascript
enhanced links, and that those links should update the
<code>#content</code> element. Of course this element must exist,
and often times you want to wrap <code>$content_for_layout</code>
with a div matching the id used for the <code>update</code> option.
You also should set <code>evalScripts</code> to true if you are
using the Mootools or Prototype adapters, without
<code>evalScripts</code> these libraries will not be able to chain
requests together. The <code>indicator</code> option is not
supported by <code>JsHelper</code> and will be ignored.</p>
<p>You then create all the links as needed for your pagination
features. Since the <code>JsHelper</code> automatically buffers all
generated script content to reduce the number of
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags in your source code you
<strong>must</strong> call write the buffer out. At the bottom of
your view file. Be sure to include:</p>
<pre>
<code>echo $this-&gt;Js-&gt;writeBuffer();</code>
</pre>
<p>If you omit this you will <strong>not</strong> be able to chain
ajax pagination links. When you write the buffer, it is also
cleared, so you don't have worry about the same Javascript being
output twice.</p>
<h4>Adding effects and transitions</h4>
<p>Since <code>indicator</code> is no longer supported, you must
add any indicator effects yourself.</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $this-&gt;Html-&gt;script('jquery'); ?&gt;
        //more stuff here.
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="content"&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $content_for_layout; ?&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;?php echo $this-&gt;Html-&gt;image('indicator.gif', array('id' =&gt; 'busy-indicator')); ?&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>With the above layout, we've included an indicator image file,
that will display a busy indicator animation that we will show and
hide with the <code>JsHelper</code>. To do that we need to update
our <code>options()</code> function.</p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;Paginator-&gt;options(array(
    'update' =&gt; '#content',
    'evalScripts' =&gt; true,
    'before' =&gt; $this-&gt;Js-&gt;get('#busy-indicator')-&gt;effect('fadeIn', array('buffer' =&gt; false)),
    'success' =&gt; $this-&gt;Js-&gt;get('#busy-indicator')-&gt;effect('fadeOut', array('buffer' =&gt; false)),
));</code>
</pre>
<p>This will show/hide the busy-indicator element before and after
the <code>#content</code> div is updated. Although
<code>indicator</code> has been removed, the new features offered
by <code>JsHelper</code> allow for more control and more complex
effects to be created.</p>
<h4>Configuring the PaginatorHelper to use a custom helper</h4>
<p>By default in 1.3 the <code>PaginatorHelper</code> uses JsHelper
to do ajax features. However, if you don't want that and want to
use the <code>AjaxHelper</code> or a custom helper for ajax links,
you can do so by changing the <code>$helpers</code> array in your
controller. After running <code>paginate()</code> do the
following.</p>
<pre>
<code>$this-&gt;set('posts', $this-&gt;paginate());
$this-&gt;helpers['Paginator'] =&gt; array('ajax' =&gt; 'Ajax');</code>
</pre>
<p>Will change the <code>PaginatorHelper</code> to use the
<code>AjaxHelper</code> for ajax operations. You could also set the
'ajax' key to be any helper, as long as that class implements a
<code>link()</code> method that behaves like
<code>HtmlHelper::link()</code></p>
